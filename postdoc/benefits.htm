<h4 id="health"><a href="health.htm">Health Insurance</a> (Office of Postdoctoral Services, Biotech 1, Suite 3000, Room 3046 Andrekia Branch at 827-6036)</h4>

<p>Individuals must hold appropriate health insurance coverage on appointment as a postdoctoral scholar, or as soon as possible thereafter. The conditions of appointment for scholars paid through the university must include   payment/contribution toward the cost of health insurance equal to the cost of individual coverage from a designated plan offered through the Office of Postdoctoral Services. <a href="health.htm">Please click here for the health insurance details</a>. This benefit should be paid as an addition to the salary/stipend level, with no deduction being made from the salary/stipend paid to the postdoctoral scholar. Office of Postdoctoral Services will work to assure that the designated plan offered through their office is one that provides reasonable benefits and is cost effective without placing an undue burden for co-payments and deductibles on the postdoctoral scholar. This payment may be made as reimbursement to the scholar for his/her purchase of health insurance on another plan with appropriate documentation to support reimbursement and coverage. Health insurance coverage for spouse and/or dependents is generally the responsibility of the postdoctoral scholar. </p>

A Roth IRA is an Individual Retirement Account that provides tax-free growth.&nbsp; Roth accounts can be obtained from a   stockbroker, mutual fund, or other provider of &quot;normal&quot; investment accounts. </p>
