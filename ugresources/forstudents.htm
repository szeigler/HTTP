<h4 id="advantage">ADVANTAGES OF AN UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h4>

<br/>

<p><strong>Research experience is valuable because it promotes:</strong>

<ul>

<li>Learning by doing &ndash; and it&rsquo;s fun! </li>

<li>Skills development, including study design, data collection, computation, analysis of findings, and communication of results. </li>

<li>Tangible outcomes such as research abstracts, conference presentations, and manuscripts grounded in real-world experience. </li>

<li>Career development opportunities such as professional networking and resume/vitae building. </li>

<li>Positive attitudes, habits, and intentions, including research ethics, perseverance, and professionalism. </li>

</ul>

<p>Take a few minutes to browse this website, and think about what you might do and how you might become involved in undergraduate research opportunities at VCU.</p>

<p>[ <a href="#top">Top of Page</a> ] </p>

<hr />

<h4 id="prepare">PREPARING YOURSELF FOR UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH</h4>

<p>Before undertaking an undergraduate research project, there   are a few steps you should take.</p>

<span><strong>Define your interests</strong></span>

<ul>

<li>Is there something you feel passionate enough about to explore? </li>

<li>What are your favorite courses? </li>

<li>Have you had a class assignment or paper that you can expand upon? </li>

<li>What previous experience or skills do you have that can be useful in   research? </li>

</ul>

<span><strong>Explore undergraduate research opportunities </strong>

</span>

<ul>

<li>Research and creative scholarship happens in every department at VCU, from   the School of the Arts to the Department of History to the School of Medicine.   Most departmental websites feature descriptions of faculty research interests   and undergraduate research opportunities. Check out the <a href="http://www.vcu.edu" target="_blank">VCU website</a>. You can start by viewing the <a href="links.htm">Links and resources</a>. </li>

</ul>

<span><strong>Plan a talk with your advisor</strong>

</span>

<ul>

<li>Make an appointment for a conference with your academic advisor or with   another faculty member you might know in your major to discuss your research   interests. </li>

</ul>

<span><strong>Pause for a moment before contacting faculty </strong>

</span>

<ul>

<li>Try to find a department contact person for undergraduate research   opportunities and issues.&nbsp; See the link on &ldquo;finding research opportunities&rdquo; </li>

<li>Approach faculty with respect and be mindful of their time. Visit during   office hours or schedule an appointment. </li>

<li>Read faculty profiles on departmental website pages to learn about their   research and publications. Make sure that you can talk about your research   interests, and ask questions about their research. </li>

<li>If your initial communication is by e-mail, use a respectful tone. Address   the faculty member as Dr. or Professor. In addition, don&rsquo;t write &ndash; HEY Dr. XX. </li>

<li>Include information about yourself and your research interests (see &ldquo;be   prepared&rdquo; below). </li>

<li>Don&rsquo;t send out mass e-mails with a general statement, such as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking   for a research project. Do you have one?&rdquo; </li>

</ul>

<span><strong>Be realistic</strong>

</span>

<ul>

<li>Think about your availability to do research. Be realistic about the amount   of time you have to devote to a research experience. The number of hours may   vary from situation to situation, but you should expect to spend at least 10   hours/week. </li>

</ul>

<span><strong>Be professional</strong>

</span>

<ul>

<li>Faculty members are looking for students who are not just high achievers and   interested in their research, but who are also reliable. </li>

</ul>

<span><strong>Be   persistent (but not a nuisance)</strong>

</span>

<ul>

<li>Don&rsquo;t get discouraged if you can&rsquo;t find a research opportunity right away.   If a faculty member doesn&rsquo;t have a position for you, he or she may be able to   recommend another faculty member. </li>

<li>The objective is to find a good fit between your interests and abilities and   those of a faculty member. </li>

<li>You may want to prepare yourself with one or more courses to make ready for   a productive research experience. Ask faculty for advice on how to prepare   yourself to be of use in their type of work. </li>

</ul>

<span><strong>Be   prepared</strong>

</span>

<ul>

<li>Have you read recent academic publications in your area of interest? Talk to   your advisor or mentor about professional publications to become familiar with. </li>

<li>Do you need specialized safety or other training to do research in your area   of interest? Talk to your advisor or faculty mentor about what it takes to be   certified safe. </li>

<li>Does your interest involve research with human or animal subjects? Click <a href="../human_research/index.htm">here</a> for more information about regulations governing research with human subjects and <a href="https://www.vcu.edu/research/acup/index.htm">here</a> for more information about regulations governing research with animal subjects. </li>

</ul>

<h4>Please recognize that research experience in many areas is highly sought   after, and available positions in your area of interest may be limited, so be   well prepared for seeking a position.</h4>

<p>Before you contact someone about a   research opportunity you may want to put together the following information to   provide to them:</p>

<ul>

<li>Your year of study (Freshman, sophomore, etc.) </li>

<li>Your major </li>

<li>Your current GPA and a copy of your transcript </li>

<li>A brief summary of your background, which indicates any research-related   courses you have taken, and any research experience you have already had. </li>

<li>A statement that talks about&nbsp;your career goals, why you want to participate   in research,&nbsp;specifics about what kind of research experience you want to get,   and what you would bring to the experience. </li>

<li>Names of 1 or 2 faculty who can speak about&nbsp;your skills, background,   interests and career goals, which indicate why you are a good candidate for an   undergraduate research experience. </li>

<li>Any abstracts you have published that may be relevant to the research work   you are seeking. </li>

</ul>

<h4 id="schedule">SCHEDULE A MEETING WITH YOUR VCU UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH COORDINATOR</h4>

<ul>
