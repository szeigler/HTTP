		<p>Note: each of the programs below has its own application requirements. Please   follow the links to determine your possible eligibility and specific contact and   application procedures.</p>

	<h4>VCU IMSD Scholars Program</h4>
  
		<p>The VCU Initiative for Maximizing Student Diversity is a biomedical research training program for undergraduate students interested in biomedical research.</p>

		<p>VCU-IMSD scholars participate in research internships in the summers following their freshman and sophomore years and during their junior and senior academic years. Scholars also enroll in a series of courses that help develop their skills in biomedical research, critical thinking, problem solving, and written and oral communication. The VCU-IMSD program also offers specialized career counseling, assistance with graduate school applications, and a Graduate Record Examination (GRE) preparation course, as well as the opportunity to attend national scientific conferences. Paid research internships are available for select scholars.</p>

		<p>The VCU-IMSD application packet includes an online application, two reference letters from science faculty members and an unofficial VCU academic transcript.</p>

		<p>For application information, <a href="http://www.dhsd.vcu.edu/programs/research/imsd.html" target="_blank">VCU IMSD Scholars Program</a></p>

	<h4>Post-baccalaureate Research Year</h4>

		<h4><a href="mailto:COHDTraining@vcu.edu">COHDTraining@vcu.edu</a></h4>

		<p>The Post-baccalaureate Research Experience Program is a one-year biomedical research training program for recent college graduates from underrepresented groups considering graduate-level training in the biomedical sciences. The program provides scholars with a year-long, paid, mentored research experience and the opportunity to develop technical and critical-thinking skills.</p>
          
		<p>PREP scholars receive competitive stipends in the amount of $20,772 for the year. At the end of the program, they will have the skills needed to successfully compete for admission into a biomedical Ph.D. program at VCU or another institution.</p>

		<p>The PREP program requires completion of the online application, two reference letters from faculty members and an official academic transcript from your university or college.</p>

		<p>Applications are accepted on a rolling basis.</p>

		<p>For application information visit the <a href="http://www.healthdisparities.vcu.edu/?id=1343&amp;sid=10" target="_blank">PREP website</a>.</p>
 
	<h4>VCU Minority Access to Research  Careers (MARC)</h4>
            
		<p>The VCU Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) is designed to provide research training for academically talented VCU juniors and seniors who are interested in biomedical research careers. The MARC program provides a stipend of approximately $11,000 per year and support for about 60 percent of undergraduate tuition. In addition to placements in research laboratories at VCU during the academic year, MARC students are eligible for summer externships at other research-intensive institutions. MARC seeks underrepresented minority students who are African-American, Hispanic American, Native American, economically disadvantaged (Pell grant-eligible) or disabled.</p>

		<p>Most MARC scholars are admitted to the program during the fall of their junior year. At that time, they are matched with research mentors and begin their research projects. During the program, students are expected to enroll in BIOL 291 (biomedical research) and a non-credit research colloquium. MARC scholars are expected to spend 15 to 20 hours a week in their research laboratories (actual time varies depending on mentor and project) and to continue their research throughout their junior and senior years. During the summer between the junior and senior years, MARC scholars have the option of continuing in their VCU research laboratories or participating in a research externship at another institution. In addition, they have the opportunity to take a GRE-preparation course and a research process course, as well as receive assistance with preparation of graduate school applications.</p>

		<p>Potential applicants to the program are encouraged to participate in research colloquia and summer research experiences before they apply.</p>

		<p class="indent"><b>Eligibility</b><br />
Eligible applicants must be VCU juniors or seniors that have four semesters left and must be U.S. citizens, permanent residents or non-citizen nationals. Proof of citizenship status or resident status will be required before the start of the program.</p>

		<p class="indent"><b>Application process</b><br />
Students should apply using the online application. Students will need to complete a short essay question, turn in two letters of recommendations from faculty members and submit official transcripts from all universities previously attended and unofficial transcripts from VCU. Priority application deadline is February 15.</p>

		<p class="indent">For questions/inquiries, please contact <a href="mailto:COHDTraining@vcu.edu">COHDTraining@vcu.edu</a>.</p>

	<h4>Summer Residential Governor&rsquo;s School for Life Sciences and   Medicine</h4>

		<p><b><a href="mailto:jtmcdonnough@vcu.edu">Jacqueline McDonnough</a></b>, Director, Center for Life Sciences Education<br/>
        
        High school juniors and seniors spend a total of four weeks at Virginia Commonwealth University discovering the newly emerging fields and advancements that will revolutionize health care and life sciences in the 21st century. Governor’s School students will experience three modules: clinical, molecular and environmental science. For the final week, students will work in groups on a project in one of the three areas. During the four-week program, students and staff live on-site at VCU as they explore and develop ideas and data together.</p>

		<p><b><a href="mailto:sruder@vcu.edu">Suzanne Ruder</a></b>, Department of Chemistry<br/>
        
        Ten students will participate in the REU program that begins with a three-day training period teaching basic skills common to all scientific research, and developing the perspectives and career planning components. Full-time research begins after this three-day period. Development of the perspectives component continues with regular meetings and presentations from faculty and from local industrial collaborators. The students oral and written communication skills are developed throughout the program by completing a written proposal, revising their personal statements submitted as part of their application and preparing and presenting a poster of their work at the halfway point and an oral presentation for the final symposium. Written reports of the students research results are also submitted at the conclusion of the program. Four teachers from area Public Schools will also participate in a seven-week RET program, doing research in faculty labs. The RET program includes two teachers who participated in the previous summers program and two teachers recommended by the returning teachers. Teachers join in all REU activities, write a research proposal and give halfway-point and final presentations on their research.</p>

	<h4>Virginia Nebraska Alliance</h4>

		<p><b><a href="mailto:tgreen@vanealliance.com">Terone Green</a></b><br/>
        
        The Virginia-Nebraska Alliance (The Alliance) is a unique partnership between unlikely partners to address the national need to diversify the healthcare and research workforce. The Alliance was formed in September 2004 between the five Historically Black Colleges/Universities (HBCUs) within Virginia: J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, the University of Nebraska Medical Center(UNMC) and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). In 2006 The Alliance welcomed the University of Richmond (UofR), the University of Virginia (UVA), and Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) as academic partners. This model partnership between academic health science centers and HBCUs can be replicated across the nation to find "missing persons" in healthcare and research professions. The <b>Summer Medical and Dental Education Program</b> is an Intensive   academic science review, opportunities to interact with current graduate   students, weekly clinical learning opportunities. <b>Summer Research - VCU,   UNMC, UVA, EVMS</b> offers Full-time summer research experience, enrichment   seminars, and poster presentation at end of summer. Through the <b>Summer   Research Experience</b> (High School), Students would participate in an   innovative program that introduces them to the health sciences, through an early   educational initiative that fosters academic achievement, career development and   enrichment experiences in the health sciences. Students would participate in a   researched based curriculum that conforms to the standards of learning and incorporates the core academic subjects of science, math and reading. Students   would have an opportunity to see first hand the relationship between academic   preparation and skills needed to be successful in the health care arena. Alliance medical and research professionals would provide hands on activities   that stimulate and encourage student learning.</p>
