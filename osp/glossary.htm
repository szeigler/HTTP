A challenge grant may, for example, offer two dollars for every one that is obtained from a fund drive. The grant usually has a fixed upper limit, and may have a challenge minimum below which no grant will be made. This form of grant is fairly common in the arts, humanities, and some other fields, but is less common in the sciences. A challenge grant differs from a <a href="#MGrant">matching grant</a> in at least one important respect: The amount of money that the recipient organization realizes from a challenge grant may vary widely, depending upon how successful that organization is in meeting the challenge. Matching grants usually award a clearly defined amount and require that a specified sum be obtained before any award is made.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Change Order</strong> A written order signed by the <a href="#COfficer">contracting officer</a>, directing the   contractor to make changes in the processes, goods and services under a contract.

In an interventional clinical trial, research subjects are assigned to a treatment or other intervention and their outcomes are measured. In an observational clinical trial, interventions given during the course of clinical care are observed and outcomes are measured by the researchers. Preclinical laboratory studies or studies in animals are not considered clinical trials.</p>

        <p><strong>Competing Proposals</strong> Proposals that are submitted for the first time or unfunded proposals that are resubmitted; either must compete for research funds. Ongoing projects must compete again if the term of the original award has expired. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Confidentiality Agreement</strong> An agreement between too parties whereby they agree to maintain confidential information received from the other party. VCU wants such information be clearly identified as proprietary and/or confidential, and wants a time limit specified for maintaining confidentiality.

        <p><strong>Consultant Agreement</strong> An agreement between an individual or organization (consultant) and the university whereby the consultant provides services of an advisory nature. The university may enter into an agreement of this type when the necessary expertise is not available within the university community. A VCU employee may not be paid as a consultant on one of VCU's sponsored programs; this principle applies at most universities. A VCU employee may not use University resources in conducting a consulting project.</p>
        
        <p id="continuation"><strong>Continuation Project (Non-Competing)</strong> Applicable to <a href="#grant">grants</a> and <a href="#Coop_Agree">cooperative agreements</a> only. A project can be approved for multiple-year funding, although funds are typically committed only one year at a time. At the end of the initial budget period, progress on the project is assessed. If satisfactory, an Continuation award is made for the next <a href="#budget_period">budget period</a>, subject to the availability of funds. Continuation projects do not compete with <a href="#new">new</a> project proposals and are not subjected to <a href="#peer">peer review</a> after the initial project approval.</p>
        
        <p id="contract"><strong>Contract</strong> A mechanism for procurement of a product or service with specific obligations for both the sponsor and recipient. Each contract document contains a statement of work or services to be performed (<a href="#ScopeOfWork">scope of work</a>) and represents a legal obligation by the contractor. Since a contract is a purchase or procurement, there will always be a <a href="#Deliverable">deliverable</a>. Contracts received by the institution are more detailed than grants or cooperative agreements in the technical requirements and sometimes in the accountability for the use of funds. Contracts issued for procurement under a sponsored program need careful review for adequacy of the <a href="#ScopeOfWork">scope of work </a>and objectivity of the statement of <a href="#Deliverable">deliverables</a>.</p>
        
        <p id="COfficer"><strong>Contract/Grant Officer</strong> A <a href="#sponsor">sponsor</a>'s designated individual who is officially responsible for the business management aspects of a particular <a href="#grant">grant</a>, <a href="#Coop_Agree">cooperative agreement</a>, or <a href="#contract">contract</a>. Serving as the counterpart to the <a href="#AuthorizedOfficial">authorized official</a> or business officer of the grantee/contractor organization, the grant/contract officer is responsible for all business management matters associated with the review, negotiation, award, and administration of a grant or contract and interprets the associated administration policies, regulations, and provisions. (For definition of scientific officer, see <a href="#Pofficer">Program/Project Officer</a>.)</p>
        
        <p id="Coop_Agree"><strong>Cooperative Agreement</strong> A federal <a href="#award">award</a> similar to a <a href="#grant">grant</a> and subject to grant regulations, but in which the <a href="#sponsor">sponsor's</a> staff may be actively involved in proposal preparation, and anticipates having substantial involvement in research activities once the award has been made.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Co-Principal Investigator, Co-PI </strong>A courtesy title for a senior investigator who is not not the <a href="#PI">Principle Investigator</a>, generally with responsibility for the conduct of a portion of the research or other activity described in a <a href="#proposal">proposal</a> or an <a href="#award">award</a>. NSF recognizes this title when there are multiple senior investigators, but states that &quot; the first one listed will have primary responsibility for the project and the submission of reports.&quot; Few other funding agencies recognize the title. VCU does not formally recognize &quot;Co-PI&quot; as different from any other investigator.</p>

        <p id="CAS"><strong>Cost Accounting Standards (CAS)</strong> Federally mandated accounting standards intended to ensure uniformity in budgeting and spending federal funds, originally applicable to commercial concerns. In April 1996, OMB revised <a href="#A21">A-21</a> to incorporate certain cost standards issued by the Cost Accounting Standards Board. Four of the CAS apply to the university: CAS 501, 502, 505, and 506.</p>
        
        <p id="Cost_Reim"><strong>Cost-Reimbursement Type Contract/Grant</strong> A <a href="#contract">contract</a>/<a href="#grant">grant</a> for which the sponsor pays for the <a href="#AllowableCosts">allowable</a> and <a href="#AllocableCosts">allocable</a> costs incurred in the conduct of the work up to an agreed-upon amount.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cost Sharing</strong> Cost sharing refers to that portion of the costs of a sponsored project that is borne by the   university. To qualify as cost sharing, a cost must be (1) verifiable from the university's records, (2) allocable as necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of the project objective, and (3) allowable under applicable cost principles and administrative regulations. Both <a href="#MandatoryCS">Mandatory</a> and <a href="#VolCommitCS">Voluntary Committed</a> cost sharing must be adequately documented in the university's records. The university will make a cost sharing commitment only when required   by the sponsor (<a href="#MandatoryCS">Mandatory</a>) or by the competitive   nature of the award and then only to the extent necessary to meet the specific requirements of the sponsored project.</p>
        
        <p><strong>CRADA or CRDA</strong> Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, originally a mechanism to transfer technology between the government and the university. CRADAs can also be used to transfer equipment, supplies, or to pay travel expenses. A CRADA is often the only mechanism to transfer funds into a federal agency, e.g., when making a subaward to a cooperating federal research laboratory.</p>

        <p><strong>Drug-free Workplace</strong> The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988. This regulation stipulates that no federal funding will be available for institutions or individuals who do not have a drug-free workplace policy in place. VCU meets all requirements of this regulations. There is no requirement for flow down to subrecipients under either grants or contracts.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Drug-free Work Force</strong> No statutory authority exists for the drug-free work force requirements. Requirements are contained in DFAR, 252.223-7004. Drug-Free Work Force addresses employee involvement with controlled substances regardless of where such involvement takes place, random drug testing of employees, and other intrusive personnel policies. This clause is only applicable to DOD solicitations and contracts involving access to classified information or when the contracting officer decides inclusion is necessary. Universities have successfully negotiated out this compliance for basic research contracts. Like the Workplace certification, there is no requirement to flow-down these provisions to subrecipients. VCU has never accepted this clause.</p>

These limits may be exceeded only at the contractor's own risk. Each increment is, in essence, a funding action.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Indemnification, Hold Harmless</strong> An indemnification clause shifts the liability or loss from one party to another, usually without regard to fault (including undertaking any legal defense) for some legal action or claim for damages taken against the indemnified party. VCU is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Virginia. By direction of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth, we are not allowed to indemnify or hold harmless any third party. We may offer instead insurance clauses.</p>
        
        <p id="indirect"><strong>Indirect Costs</strong> Costs related to expenses incurred in conducting or supporting research or other externally-funded activities but not directly attributable to a specific project. General categories of indirect costs include general administration (accounting, payroll, purchasing, etc.), sponsored project administration, plant operation and maintenance, library expenses, departmental administration expenses, depreciation or use allowance for buildings and equipment, and student   administration and services. (See also <a href="#fac_admin">Facilities and Administrative Costs.</a>)</p>
        
        <p><strong>Indirect Cost Rate</strong> The rate, expressed as a percentage of a base amount (<a href="#MTDC">MTDC </a>for most universities), established by negotiation with the cognizant federal agency on the basis of the institution's projected costs for the year and distributed as prescribed in <a href="#A21">OMB Circular A-21</a>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (<a href="https://www.vcu.edu/research/acup/index.htm">IACUC</a>)</strong> A committee set up within the university charged with the oversight of research with vertebrate animals, and of the facilities in which that research occurs. Research protocols involving vertebrate animals must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to initiation. Federal and some other sponsors require this approval prior to receipt of an award. An institution must provide an acceptable written assurance   to the Office for Protection from Research Risks, NIH, that the institution is complying with the Animal Welfare Act, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and other applicable laws and regulations. Recipients must maintain records of committee activities which are treated as award related records for the purpose of access and retention.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong> In very general terms, an IP is the result of using one's intellect to create something new and different from whatever was known before. IP is also a legal concept, inasmuch, as like other property, it can be owned, sold, rented, given away, etc. lPs are protected by patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and know-how (secrecy). By state law, VCU must retain title to any and all intellectual properties (patents, copyrights, trademarks) developed with significant use of general funds, except with prior approval from the Governor. However, the University or its VCU Intellectual Property Foundation can license IP.</p>
        
        <p id="IPA"><strong>Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Agreement</strong> A mechanism by which an employee of state   government may be assigned to work for a federal agency, or <em>vice versa</em>, while remaining on the payroll of the &quot;home&quot; government, retaining his leave and benefits status. This is often used for a temporary (up to one year) assignment of a faculty member to a federal agency. The &quot;borrowing&quot; government reimburses the &quot;lending&quot; government for salary and benefits, and may directly pay a cost of living or relocation allowance. VCU treats an IPA as a sponsored program (with no F&amp;A) as an administrative convenience.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Interim Funding</strong> Authorization to expend funds on a project to a specified limit before the award document has been received from the <a href="#sponsor">sponsor</a>.</p>
        
        <p id="IFB"><strong>Invitation for Bid (IFB)</strong> A solicitation issued to prospective bidders. An IFB describes what is required and how the bidders will be evaluated. <a href="#award">Award</a> is based on the lowest bid. Negotiations are not conducted.</p>

        <p><strong>IRB Institutional Review Board (for Human Subjects Research)</strong> <a href="../human_research/index.htm">IRB</a> is a   committee(s) set up within the university charged with the oversight of research with human subjects. Research protocols involving live human subjects must be reviewed and approved by the IRB prior to initiation of the research. Federal and some other sponsors require this approval prior to issuing an award. An institution must provide an acceptable written assurance to the Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP), that the institution is in compliance with 45 CFR 46 and other applicable laws and regulations. Recipients must maintain records of committee activities which are treated as award related records for the purpose of access and retention.</p>

    <p id="MGrant"><strong>Matching Grant</strong> A grant that requires a specified portion of the cost of a supported item of equipment or project be obtained from other sources, as <a href="#MandatoryCS">mandatory cost sharing</a>. The required match may be more or less than the amount of the grant. Some matching grants require that the additional funds be obtained from sources outside the recipient organization. Some matching grants are paid in installments, the payments coinciding with the attainment of pre-specified   levels of additional funding. (Also see <a href="#CGrant">Challenge Grant</a>.)

        <p><strong>Stipend</strong> A payment made to an individual under a fellowship or training grant in accordance with   pre-established levels to provide for the individual's living expenses during the period of training. Expressly, this is NOT an employer-employee relationship. Stipends may NOT be paid from any other type of grant although students may be employed on them.

VCU should not agree to an exclusive teaming arrangement, as this would prevent any other PI at the university from working on research of this type with any agency. VCU can agree that it, with a specific PI can team exclusively, but the industry must understand that VCU may team with another organization using another PI.
