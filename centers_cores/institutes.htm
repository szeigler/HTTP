        In operation since 2006, the VCU School of Pharmacy’s Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine develops and applies novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding, and to tailor medication use in individual patients with the goals of enhancing efficacy and minimizing toxicity. High-dimensional investigations where (hundreds of) thousands of genotypes, transcripts, methylation markers, and metabolites are measured together with environmental risk factors and clinical information are considered powerful tools to achieve these goals and are, therefore, an important focus of the research . The center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective and the primary applications involve substance use disorders and psychiatric outcomes.<br/>
