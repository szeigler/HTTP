    	<h4><a id="flow_cytometry"></a>VCU Flow Cytometry Core  Laboratory:</h4>
        
        	<p>&quot;The VCU Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory was established in 1976, and has been constantly modernized since that time. It currently occupies over 1500 sq ft in the Kontos Medical Science Building and the Molecular Medicine Research Building, and provides a comprehensive instrumentation suite and technical services in support of both cell sorting and analysis on a fee-for-service basis. The core currently features six primary instruments. Cell sorting is conducted using two multi-laser BD Aria II sorters. One of the Aria units is enclosed in a Baker BioProtect Hood, enabling the sorting of human and biohazardous tissues. The two Aria IIs have UV and violet laser capability and up to 4 simultaneous sorts per Aria II. In addition the core has a 4 laser Mark II Imagestream analyzer which acquires images of cell populations for analysis.  Flow analyzers include a two laser Beckman Canto II and as of June 2014, a 3 laser BD Fortessa, The two analyzers are  capable of  9 or 14 color simultaneous analysis, respectively. In addition to flow instrumentation, the core also maintains a Biacore T100 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) instrument for determination of protein interaction constants. The director, Daniel H. Conrad, has over 25 years of experience in flow cytometry. The laboratory manager and head technician, Julie Farnsworth, is highly trained in flow cytometry has been with the core for more than 9 years. The resource provides a wide range of services, including instrument training, routine fluorescence analysis, and development of innovative custom analysis and sorting protocols. Walk-up instrument time is also available to trained users. This core maintains a stable base of instrumentation, expertise, and trained personnel and currently provides services and training for multiple users in over 60 research groups from 21 departments at VCU. The Flow Cytometry Core laboratory is supported, in part, by funding from the NIH-NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (P30 CA016059)&quot;</p>
            
     	<h4><a id="mass_spec"></a>VCU Chemical and Proteomic Mass Spectrometry Core Facility</h4>
        	
            <p>The VCU Chemical and Proteomic Mass Spectrometry Core Facility (Mass Spectrometry Facility) offers a wide variety of services ranging from routine mass spectrometry analysis to interactive custom design of innovative analyses, addressing the specific needs of individual investigators. The resource director closely follows the analyses performed by the facility, insuring quality control and advising facility users on alternative, often novel, approaches to experimental design and data analysis.  The shared resource maintains a stable base of instrumentation, including the QTofII from Waters Corporation, used primarily for basic mass measurement.  Routine proteomics experiments are performed on a 5800 MALDI TOF-TOF instrument from AB Sciex, which utilizes off-line separations performed on an Easy nLC HPLC system from Thermo Electron and a spotter robot from Leap Technologies.  The MALDI instrument can handle basic proteomics experiments such as analysis of the proteins in gel bands, as well as basic mass measurement.  It has high mass accuracy and the ability to measure samples multiple times to increase the number of peptides identified in each experiment.  More complex proteomics experiments are handled by an Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer from Thermo Electron Corporation, which is interfaced to a nanoAcuity UPLC from Waters Corporation.  The addition of this instrument to the shared resource facility has greatly increased the ability to process samples requiring high sensitivity as well as high mass accuracy.  This cutting-edge technology has also provides the ability to handle samples which are extremely complex, by fronting the analytical column with an SCX trap column.  Experiments using this pseudo-2D separation approach have yielded over 800 proteins from a single sample.  Finally, the Mass Spectrometry Facility provides data analysis, including database searching of the peptides detected by mass spectrometry and identify proteins present in the samples, and mapping of the detected peptides within the protein.  Data are shared with investigators using Scaffold software, which has been developed with a user interface allowing investigators to see where peptides are located within the protein, examine a list of proteins detected within the sample, look at fragmentation spectra and scoring values for each peptide, and even compare proteins and peptides across a number of samples.</p>

      	<h4><a id="tissue_data"></a>VCU Tissue and Data Analysis and Acquisition Core Laboratory</h4>
        
        	<p>&ldquo;The VCU Tissue and Data Analysis and Acquisition Core (TDAAC; Directors Catherine Dumur, Ph.D., and David Williams, M.D.), established in 2002 and located in the 6,400 sq ft VCU Molecular Diagnostics Facility, has as its goal the acquisition  of human specimens and associated clinical and pathological findings to support translational research. This is done both through the aegis of the VCU-IRB approved &ldquo;Tissue Acquisition System to Support Cancer Research&rdquo; (TASSCR) protocol, which supplies specimens to a biorepository supporting cancer  research through acquisition of residual tumor and normal tissue samples along with informed consent from patients with cancer. In addition, TDAAC collects tissue, hematopoietic and serum samples which support specific investigator initiated IRB approved research projects. The specimen acquisition process ensures that the primary purpose of the specimen for patient care is maintained and the quality of the specimen is optimal for biomedical research. These services are  achieved through leveraging a network of interdepartmental and informatics relationships within the VCU Health Systems. TDAAC staff in collaboration with Department of Pathology based Molecular Morphology Genomics Laboratory and Laser Capture Microdissection Laboratory provide samples of extracted, quality controlled RNA and DNA from human tissues, frozen sections, and cryopreserved samples of viable hematopoietic neoplasias. Because TDAAC is an outgrowth of a multicenter grant that focused on gene expression microarray studies on multiple cancer phenotypes, some  samples have associated gene expression data as a part of their annotation. The VCU Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory is a state-of-the art CLIA-certified laboratory and performs clinical as well as research molecular testing with state-of-the-art equipment, including one bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100), two robotic systems for automated nucleic acid extraction (Roche MagNA Pure LC  System), automated DNA sequencers (ABI 310, and 3100), several real-time PCR instrumentation systems (including ABI 7700 and 7500, as well as a Roche LightCycler™ System), a Thermo Spectrophotometer; a Leica CM1850 Cryostat, four Thermo Scientific Revco PLUS Ultra-Low Temperature Freezers, three Thermo Scientific Locator 4 PLUS Cryobiological Storage Vessels, a NanoDrop ND 1000  Spectrophotometer, an Applied Biosystems MagMAX Express nucleic acid extractor, and a complete Affymetrix GeneChip® workstation for DNA microarray  technology. All temperature-sensitive  equipment is constantly monitored by an electronic system (CheckPoint: 24/7  monitoring system) and all ultra-low freezers have a built-in LN2  backup system that automatically releases LN2 into the freezer in case of temperature failure. The VCU TDAAC is supported, in part, by funding from the NIH-NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (P30 CA016059)&rdquo;</p>
            
      	<h4><a id="matr"></a>VCU Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry:</h4>
        
        	<p>&ldquo;The Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry (MATR; Scientific Director Judy Silberg; http://www.matr.vcu.edu/ is located at the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics (VIPBG), under the Office of the VP Research at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The MATR is a population-based registry of twin pairs ascertained from birth records and school system records of Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The registry&rsquo;s mission is to identify, trace and recruit population based samples of twins and their families to participate in research undertaken by scientists at VCU and other institutions. The registry conducts and/or facilitates such research through collection of preliminary data and referral of eligible subjects to investigators while protecting the rights and privacy of study participants. The subjects have primarily been drawn from the more than 170,000 identical and fraternal twin pairs born in the three states between 1913 and 2009. Many of the twins and their family members have participated in numerous research projects. To fulfill its goal to be a model for the protection of the privacy of research participants, the MATR has established a privacy policy and strict Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to protect the confidentiality of participant data. These SOPs address such issues as respect to participants, protection of privacy, confidentiality of data transmission etc. Employees sign an understanding that breach of these  procedures is grounds for dismissal. The MATR twin pairs join the registry with  an interest in promoting genetic and health research and are therefore willing to provide appropriate samples as requested by studies. The MATR can promote research in various ways, including arranging DNA collection (blood, bucal  swab, or saliva), mailed or web surveys, telephone recruitment, or advertisments in the MATR newsletter distributed annually to all registrants. MATR also coordinates with researchers to ensure proof of human subjects protection review and other subject protections prior to initiation of any study.</p>

A Zeiss Discovery V20 Stereo zoom microscope with transmitted, reflection and fluorescence illumination, 0.63x, 1.25x and 1.5x lenses, filter sets for GFP, CFP, YFP and DsRed and a Axiocam MRc CCD camera is available for micro/macroscopic imaging; 7) The facility houses a Bruker Catalyst Atomic Force microscope. The AFM resides on a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 inverted microscope stand equipped with fluorescence optics, and an AxioCam MRm CCD camera for the concurrent imaging of fluorescent signals. A heater/perfusion chamber is available to permit live-cell imaging. 8) A Nikon N-SIM Structured Illumination Microscope (“Super-Resolution”) is to be installed in the facility during March, 2014.  This system will be equipped with 3 diffraction gratings, 4 lasers (405, 488, 561 & 640 nm), Andor iXon DU-897E emCCD camera, a laser-based automated focus drift compensation system, motorized XY stage, a high resolution piezo-driven Z stage, motorized TIRF optics, fluorescence optics, DIC, and a stage incubator (to facilitate live cell imaging).  This equipment suite (supported by sputter coaters, ultramicrotomes, critical point dryers, etc.) allows the core to offer many types of imaging methods and services including: Sample preparation; Live-cell imaging; Immuno-localization (fluorescence, EM); Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP); Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The core also provides multi-dimensional image analysis. A cell culture facility (with incubators and biological safety cabinet) is located on-site to support live cell imaging. Training is available for all of the imaging modalities and methods offered.  The VCU microscopy core laboratory is supported, in part, by the NIH-NINDS center core grant 5P30NS047463.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>&ldquo;The VCU Nanomaterials Characterization Core Laboratory (Director Everett Carpenter, Ph.D.), founded in 2010, is VCUs newest core laboratory. The nanomaterials core provides a comprehensive instrumentation suite for VCU researchers interested in nanomaterials, or surface characterization. The facility features a ThermoFisher ESCAlab 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The ESCALab is multitechnique platform for studying the surface of materials. The instrument is equipped with a 95 mm field emission gun for Auger spectroscopy and SEM imaging with a 90nm spatial resolution and a UV photoelectron lamp. The sample stage is an automated 5-axis stage for angle resolved XPS with heating and cooling from 77K to 600K. The system also has a High Pressure Gas Cell for introduction of reactive gases for absorption studies. The center also has three scanning electron microscopes and a transmission electron microscope: a Hitachi SU-70 FE-SEM, a Jeol JSM-5610 LV, Zeiss Auriga SEM/FIB, and  Zeiss libra 120 TEM. The Hitachi SEM is a field emission unit which allows for a 1nm spatial resolution. The unit also is equipped with a STEM options, a Nabity Lithography System, dedicated backscatter detector, and Genesis EDAX system with low element windows for detection of Be to Pu. The Jeol system is also equipped with an Oxford EDS system and is equipped for High Vacuum SEM as well as Low Pressure SEM functions. The Libra is Zeiss workhorse microscope which features point to point resolution of 0.34 nm. Included in the scope is an in-column Omega filter which allows for energy electron lose spectroscopy (EELS) with an energy resolution of &lt;1.5 eV. The microscopy features a GATAN bottom mount camera for acquisition of digital images. The Zeiss Auriga is a dual beam focused ion beam scanning electron microscope.  The instrument features and Genesis EDAX system with low element window and an EBSD dector.  The center also houses a VEECO ICON atomic force microscope. The ICON features VEECO's latest technology providing AFM with less than a 35 pm signal to noise operating in tapping mode. The instrument is capable of operating in multiple modes including lateral force (LFM), magnetic force (MFM), surface potential, scanning capacitance (SCM), Tunneling (TUNA or STM), and conductive (CAFM). The instrument is equipped with a variable temperature stage and a wet cell sample holder.  The laboratory features a number of other instruments including; Zeiss LSM-710 confocal microscope, SkyScan 1173 u-CT scanner, Quantum Design Versalab platform, Viscotek GPCMax, Rame-Hart Contact Angle, and PANalytical X-ray fluorescence spectrometer.  Acquisition of instrumentation in the Nanomaterials Characterization Core laboratory was funded, in part, by grants from the National Science Foundation.&rdquo;</p>
