    	<h4 id="flow_cytometry">The VCU Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory (updated July 2015)</h4>
        
        	<p>"The VCU Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory was established in 1976, and has been constantly modernized since that time. It currently occupies over 1500 sq. ft. in the Molecular Medicine Research Building and the Kontos Medical Science Building, and provides a comprehensive instrumentation suite and technical service in support of both cell sorting and analysis on a fee-for-service basis. The core currently features six primary instruments. Cell sorting is conducted using two multi-laser BD Aria II sorters. One of the Aria sorters is enclosed in a Baker BioProtect III Hood, enabling the sorting of human and biohazardous tissues. The two Arias have UV and violet laser capability and up to 4 simultaneous sorts per Aria. In addition the core has a 4 laser Amnis ImageStream Mark II analyzer which acquires images of cell populations for analysis. Flow analyzers include a two laser BD FACSCanto II and as of June 2015, a 5 laser BD LSRFortessa X-20. The two analyzers are capable of 9 or 18 color simultaneous analyses, respectively and the 5 laser makes compensation with multiple colors easier. In addition to flow instrumentation, the core also maintains a Biacore T200 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) instrument for determination of protein interaction constants. The director, Daniel H. Conrad, has over 30 years of experience in flow cytometry. The laboratory manager and head technician, Julie Farnsworth, is highly trained in flow cytometry and has been with the core for more than 15 years. The other support technician, Qingzhao Zhang has more than 7 years of flow cytometry experience and assists with both flow analysis and sorting. The resource provides a wide range of services, including instrument training, routine fluorescence analysis, and development of innovative custom analysis and sorting protocols. Walk-up instrument time is also available to trained users. This core maintains a stable base of instrumentation, expertise, and trained personnel and currently provides services and training for multiple users in over 60 research groups from 21 departments at VCU.

     	<h4 id="mass_spec">The VCU Chemical and Proteomic Mass Spectrometry Core Facility (updated July 2015)</h4>
        	
            <p>The Chemical and Proteomic Mass Spectrometry Core Facility offers a wide variety of services ranging from routine mass spectrometry analysis to interactive custom design of innovative analyses, addressing the specific needs of individual investigators. The resource director closely follows the analyses performed by the facility, insuring quality control and advising facility users on alternative, often novel, approaches to experimental design and data analysis. The shared resource maintains a stable base of instrumentation.  Routine proteomics experiments are performed on a 5800 MALDI TOF-TOF instrument from AB Sciex, which utilizes off-line separations performed on an Easy nLC HPLC system from Thermo Electron and a spotter robot from Leap Technologies. The MALDI instrument can handle basic proteomics experiments such as analysis of the proteins in gel bands, as well as basic mass measurement. It has high mass accuracy and the ability to measure samples multiple times to increase the number of peptides identified in each experiment. More complex proteomics experiments are handled by an Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer from Thermo Electron Corporation, which is interfaced to a nanoAcuity UPLC from Waters Corporation. Newly added in Q2 2015 is a state-of-the-art Waters Synapt G2Si mass spectrometer with electron mobility capability and M-Class UPLC front end.  This instrument is ideal for the analysis of unlabelled clinical samples and highly complex proteomics samples.  Finally, the Mass Spectrometry Facility provides data analysis, including database searching of the peptides detected by mass spectrometry, identification of proteins present in the samples, and mapping of the detected peptides within the protein. Verification of post-translational modifications is also provided.  Data are shared with investigators using Scaffold software, which has been developed with a user interface allowing investigators to see where peptides are located within the protein, examine a list of proteins detected within the sample, look at fragmentation spectra and scoring values for each peptide, and even compare proteins and peptides across a number of samples.</p>

        <h4 id="tissue_data">VCU Tissue and Data Analysis and Acquisition Core Laboratory (updated July 2015)</h4>
        
        	<p>“The VCU Tissue and Data Analysis and Acquisition Core (TDAAC; Directors Catherine Dumur, Ph.D., and Michael Idowu, M.D.), established in 2002 and located in the 6,400 sq ft VCU Molecular Diagnostics CLIA-certified laboratory, has as its goal the acquisition of human specimens and associated clinical and pathological findings to support translational research. This is done both through the aegis of the VCU-IRB approved “Tissue Acquisition System to Support Cancer Research” (TASSCR) protocol, which supplies specimens to a biorepository supporting cancer research through acquisition of residual tumor and normal tissue samples along with informed consent from patients with cancer. In addition, TDAAC collects tissue, hematopoietic and other researcher-specific samples which support investigator-initiated IRB approved research projects. The specimen acquisition process ensures that the primary purpose of the specimen for patient care is maintained and the quality of the specimen is optimal for biomedical research. These services are achieved through leveraging a network of interdepartmental and informatics relationships within the VCU Health Systems. TDAAC staff in collaboration with Department of Pathology based Molecular Morphology Genomics Laboratory provide samples of extracted, quality controlled RNA and DNA from human tissues, frozen sections, and cryopreserved samples of viable hematopoietic neoplasias. Because TDAAC is an outgrowth of a multicenter grant that focused on gene expression microarray studies on multiple cancer phenotypes, some samples have associated gene expression data as a part of their annotation. The VCU Molecular Diagnostics laboratory is a state-of-the art CLIA-certified laboratory and performs clinical as well as research molecular testing with state-of-the-art equipment, including two bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100), six robotic systems for automated nucleic acid extraction (two Qiagen EZ1 Advanced XL, two Qiagen EZ1, and two Life Technologies MagMAX Express instruments), automated DNA sequencers (two ABI 3130), six real-time PCR instrumentation systems (four ABI  7500, and two Roche LightCycler™ Systems); a Leica CM1850 Cryostat, four Thermo Scientific Revco PLUS Ultra-Low Temperature Freezers, three Thermo Scientific Locator 4 PLUS Cryobiological Storage Vessels, three NanoDrop ND 8000 Spectrophotometer, ; a complete Affymetrix GeneChip® workstation for DNA microarray technology; as well as Next-Generation Sequencing instruments (two Ion Torrent PGMs, and two Ion Torrent Protons). All temperature-sensitive equipment is constantly monitored by an electronic system (CheckPoint: 24/7 monitoring system) and all ultra-low freezers have a built-in LN2 backup system that automatically releases LN2 into the freezer in case of temperature failure. The VCU TDAAC is supported, in part, by funding from the NIH-NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (P30 CA016059)”</p>
        
        <h4 id="matr">VCU Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry (updated July 2015)</h4>
        
        	<p>The Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry (MATR; Scientific Director Judy Silberg; www.matr.vcu.edu) is located in the Office of Research and Innovation at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The MATR is a population-based registry of twin pairs ascertained from birth records and school system records of Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The registry’s mission is to identify, trace, and recruit population based samples of twins and their families to participate in research undertaken by scientists at VCU and other institutions. The registry conducts and/or facilitates such research through collection of preliminary data and referral of eligible subjects to investigators while protecting the rights and privacy of study participants. The subjects have primarily been drawn from the more than 170,000 identical and fraternal twin pairs born in the three states between 1913 and 2013. Many of the twins and their family members have participated in numerous research projects. To fulfill its goal to be a model for the protection of the privacy of research participants, the MATR has established a privacy policy and strict Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to protect the confidentiality of participant data. These SOPs address such issues as respect to participants, protection of privacy, confidentiality of data transmission etc. Employees sign an understanding that breach of these procedures is grounds for dismissal. The MATR twin pairs join the registry with an interest in promoting genetic and health research and are therefore willing to provide appropriate samples as requested by studies. The MATR can promote research in various ways, including arranging DNA collection (blood, bucal swab, or saliva), mailed or web surveys, telephone recruitment, or advertisements in the MATR newsletter distributed semi-annually to all registrants. The MATR also coordinates with researchers to ensure proof of human subjects protection review and other subject protections prior to initiation of any study.</p>
