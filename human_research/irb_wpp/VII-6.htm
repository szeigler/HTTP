  <p class="style4">Policy Statement</p>

<p>Consistent with federal regulations, VCU requires reporting to the IRB of unanticipated problems posing risks to participants or others. This policy applies to both behavioral research and biomedical research and includes (but is not limited to) the reporting of adverse events, protocol deviations/violations, and confidentiality breaches. All unanticipated problems reported to Western IRB (WIRB) by VCU investigators should also be submitted to the VCU Office for Research Subject Protections.</p>

<p class="style4">Description and Procedures</p>

<ol type="A">

  <li><em><strong>Key Definitions:</strong></em>

<p>While there are many unique terms to define a given  type of reportable events (e.g., serious adverse event, adverse event, adverse experience, etc.), the VCU IRB uses the following single definition for an IRB-reportable  event:</p>

<ol type="1">

    <li>&quot;Unanticipated Problem&quot; (UP): An unanticipated problem involving risk to  participants or others is defined by meeting ALL 3  of the following criteria:

    <ol type="a">

      <li>Was not anticipated or foreseen;</li>

      <li>Involves risk or harm to participants or others; AND</li>

      <li><p>Was probably or definitely related to, or caused by, the research activity in the judgment of the investigator.</p>

        <p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: UPs are &quot;unanticipated&quot; and therefore are generally not  previously identified in the consent document. Anticipated problems occurring at a greater severity or frequency than  previously expected may qualify as unanticipated problems reportable to the  IRB. UPs that occur on-site or external to VCU IRB jurisdiction must be  reported in the same way. Protocol deviations to minimize immediate risk or  protocol violations involved in risk or harm to subjects or others are also  considered unanticipated problems for reporting purposes (see definition  below).</em></p></li>

    </ol>
    
    </li>

    <li>&quot;Protocol  Deviation&quot;: Any change to  the IRB-approved protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate an  apparent immediate hazard to a research participant(s).</li>

  <li>&ldquo;Protocol Violation&rdquo;: An accidental or unintentional change to the  IRB approved protocol that harmed participants or others or that indicates  participants or others may be at increased risk of harm.</li>

  <li>&quot;Promptly&quot;: Federal regulations state that all UPs (involving risks to research participants or others) must be reported promptly  to the IRB. The VCU IRB has provided a  specific window of 5 working days (Monday-Friday) for reporting unanticipated  problems involving risk or harm to subjects or others. Every effort should be  made to report all UPs as soon as possible. The VCU IRB requests information in  order to monitor compliance with the prompt reporting requirement.</li>

  <li>&quot;Research Setting&quot;: The research setting refers to the research  site and the IRB responsible for that site. The terms below specify the research setting in terms of IRB  jurisdiction:

    <ol type="a">

      <li>Internal - An 'internal' UP involves a research site  under the jurisdiction of the VCU IRB.</li>

      <li>External - An  'external' UP involves a research site that is NOT under the jurisdiction of  the VCU IRB.</li>

    </ol>

    <p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: In multicenter studies, the VCU IRB only has  jurisdiction over the research activities carried out under the direct control of the VCU principal investigator. </em></p>

</ol>

</li>


      <li><em><strong>Scope of  Unanticipated Problems:</strong></em>

      <p>The scope of what qualifies as an unanticipated  problem for any given research study includes one or more of the following:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>An  adverse event (including on-site and off-site adverse events, injuries, side  effects, deaths, or other problems), which in the opinion of the principal investigator meets the definition of UP (stated above).</li>

        <li>An unexpected increase in frequency or severity of an otherwise expected event.</li>

        <li>New information from the literature, sponsor, lead site, and/or safety monitoring board that increases the risk to participants </li>

        <li>Sponsor-imposed protocol suspension for harm or increased risk to participants or other sponsor actions involving risk </li>

        <li>Changes in labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic used in the research. </li>

        <li>Breach of confidentiality involving risk or harm to subjects or others (eg., lost, stolen, or missing data).</li>

        <li>Protocol  deviation, such as any change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to  eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research participant(s).</li>

        <li>Protocol violation, such as any accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved  protocol that involved harm to participants or indicates increased risk of harm.</li>

        <li>Any complaint of a participant that indicates an unanticipated risk or which cannot  be resolved by the research staff.</li>

        <li>NOTE: Incarceration of a participant in a protocol  not approved to enroll prisoners may be viewed as an unanticipated problem.</li>

      </ol>
      
    </li>

      <li><em><strong>PI UP Report Preparation:</strong></em>

  <p>The principal investigator is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the information provided in the unanticipated problem report (including relevant dates, event description, actions taken, next actions, etc.) is comprehensive, accurate, and complete. The VCU IRB Prompt Report is to be submitted to the VCU Office for Research Subjects Protection.</p>
  
  </li>

  <li><em><strong>IRB Process for Reported Events:</strong></em>

  <p>Reportable events are received/opened/date stamped  by the intake coordinator and sorted by category/class.</p>

  <ol>

    <li><strong>Unanticipated Problems that Involve Risk to Subjects  or Others (UPs):</strong> All UPs are promptly provided to appropriateIRB staff. IRB staffprovides all necessary information to the Chairperson of the panel (and/or designated reviewer). This informationincludes at a minimum: the report, the protocol, the consent form, and if relevant, the sponsor proposal, the investigator brochure, and any other materials deemed necessary for review of the UP. The Chairperson (and/or designated reviewer of the protocol) evaluates the UP and may consult the investigator, other panel members, or other ORSP staff as appropriate. If the IRB Chair/reviewer ascertains, after consultation, that the problem is NOT an unanticipated problem involving risks to participants or others, no further action is taken by the IRB. In cases of extreme urgency, the Chairperson (and/or designated reviewer) may act independently in order to ensure the immediate safety of the research participants.

    <p><em>For UPs associated with  expedited or full board studies, the Chairperson (and/or designated reviewer)  may take the following actions:</em></p>

    <ol type="a">

      <li>Verify that the 'UP' meets the defined criteria. </li>

      <li>Require any actions necessary to ensure the ongoing safety of research participants,  including the following which are in no particular order:

        <ol type="i">

          <li>Modification of the research protocol;</li>

          <li>Modification of the information disclosed during the  consent process;</li>

          <li>Additional information provided to past participants;</li>

          <li>Notification of current participants (required when such information may relate to  participants' willingness to continue to take part in the research);</li>

          <li>Requirement that current participants re-consent to participation;</li>

          <li>Modification of the continuing review schedule;</li>

          <li>Monitoring of the research;</li>

          <li>Monitoring of the consent;</li>

          <li>Suspension of a portion or all of the research;</li>

          <li>Termination of the research;</li>

          <li>Request an emergency panel meeting to discuss</li>

          <li>Request more information from the principal investigator;</li>

          <li>Referral to  other organizational entities (e.g., legal counsel, institutional official); and/or</li>

          <li>No  action (if appropriate).</li>

          </ol>

        </li>

      <li>UPs for non-exempt protocols must be referred for review to the next meeting of the relevant IRB Panel, regardless of whether the protocol was initially approved via Full Board review. The Panel is to make the following determinations:

        <ol type="i">

          <li>confirm that the designation of UP applies,</li>

          <li>evaluate the adequacy of immediate actions taken by the  investigator to protect the subject or others from further risk,</li>

          <li>determine the status of actions taken by the Chair/designee,</li>

          <li>determine whether other actions are indicated, including changes to the research and  consent form, and </li>

          <li>indicate that for non-exempt research a UP report will  be submitted to OHRP and other appropriate entities by the ORSP.</li>

          </ol>

        </li>

      <li>For  UPs that are accompanied by, or are the result of, a protocol deviation or  violation, the IRB is also to determine whether the protocol deviation/variance  describes Serious or Continuing Non-Compliance. If so, ORSP will  also submit such a report to OHRP and the sponsor.</li>

    </ol>
    
    </li>

    <li><p><strong>Protocol Deviations and Violations</strong> - Protocol deviations and violations (that caused harm or increased risk) are Unanticipated Problems (as defined in this WPP). The action(s) taken by the IRB in review of the protocol deviation/violation are as outlined above. If the IRB Chair/reviewer ascertains that the protocol deviation/violation does NOT constitute an unanticipated problem involving risks to participants or others, the IRB will still need to determine whether the protocol deviation/violation constituted Serious or Continuing Non-Compliance.</p>

    <p>Protocol deviations and violations (as previously  defined) for non-exempt protocols must be referred for review to the next  meeting of the relevant IRB Panel, regardless of whether the protocol was  initially approved via Full Board review.&nbsp;  The Panel is to make the following determinations: </p>

    <ol type="a" class="no_margin">

      <li>confirm that a protocol deviation or violation occurred,</li>

      <li>evaluate the adequacy of immediate actions taken to protect the subject or others from further risk, and </li>

      <li>determine whether other or additional actions are indicated, including changes to the research and consent form, </li>

      <li>determine if a corrective action plan is indicated for the protocol deviation or violation, and evaluate whether the protocol deviation or violation constitutes Serious or Continuing Non-Compliance. If so, ORSP may also submit such a report to OHRP and other relevant oversight entities, in accordance with the requirements of federal oversight agencies.</li>

    </ol>

  </li>
  
  </ol>
  
  </li>

  <li><em><strong>Documenting the  Review of Reported Events:</strong></em>

  <p>Decisions of the Chairperson and designated reviewers of promptly reportable events concerning only exempt protocols will be documented in writing and reported to the appropriate IRB Panel each month. This documentation will be stored as part of the official record with the minutes and agenda from that meeting. The VCU ORSP reports unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others and Serious or Continuing Non-compliance in accordance with the requirements of federal oversight agencies.</p>

</li>

  <li><em><strong>PI Responsibility to Monitor ALL Problems:</strong></em>

  <p>As a reminder, anticipated problems should not be  reported to the VCU IRB, unless they represent a trend or concerns involving  risk that were NOT anticipated. It is  the responsibility of the principal investigator to monitor ALL PROBLEMS that  involve risk to research participants or others, both unanticipated and  anticipated.</p>

  <p>The investigator/research team is to maintain a log  of anticipated problems, participant questions and complaints, as well as,  other issues that arise within the conduct of the research that do not rise to  the level of unanticipated problem requiring prompt reporting to the IRB.</p>

    <p><strong><em>The investigator/research staff should:</em></strong></p>

    <ol class="no_margin">

      <li>Record the occurrence of the problem within their log;</li>

      <li>Consider the need for clarification of the nature of  the problem within the consent document (submitting any clarifications to the  consent document to the VCU IRB for prior review and approval);</li>

      <li>Consider the need to further review and analyze event  trends (including the need to document new procedures for handling events  and/or educate the research staff about new event procedures);</li>

      <li>Consider the need to change research procedures (submitting any request for changes to the VCU IRB for prior review and  approval);</li>

      <li>Consider the option to consult with the IRB Chairperson and/or reviewer (as needed); and,</li>

      <li>Recognize that the IRB may request some, or all, of the investigator's log and related documentation at the time of continuing review.</li>

    </ol>
