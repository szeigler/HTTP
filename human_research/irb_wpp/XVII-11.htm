  <p class="style4">Policy Statement</p>

<p>All research conducted outside of the United States must comply with standard requirements established throughout the VCU IRB Written Policies and Procedures including policies for determining investigator qualifications to conduct the proposed research, initial review and approval, modifications to research, continuing review, reporting of unanticipated problems or non-compliance, and handling of complaints, among others.  In addition, all international studies must 1) involve a cultural consultant who will be available to advise the investigator as well as the IRB prior to initiation of the research; 2) utilize translated research documents including informed consent forms and research instruments; and 3) when applicable, provide access to ongoing cultural expertise to advise the investigator as study conduct progresses.  When a foreign institution is engaged in expedited or full review research, local IRB or Ethics Committee review is required.</p>

<p class="style4">Procedures and Guidance</p>

<p>Research conducted by VCU researchers in foreign countries falls under VCU IRB policies and procedures.</p>

<p>The key to determining what additional details must be in  the application to the VCU IRB is FIRST determining if the foreign institution  is also <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/assurance/engage.htm" target="_blank">ENGAGED</a> in the human subjects research activity. A simple definition (and link to additional  information) is provided below:</p>

<div class="box_text indent">

	<p>An institution becomes &quot;engaged&quot; in human subjects research when its employees or agents1 (i) intervene or interact    with living individuals for research purposes; or (ii) obtain individually identifiable private information for research purposes <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm#46.102" target="_blank">[45 CFR 46.102(d),(f)]</a>. Please refer to    the OHRP guidance, <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/assurance/engage.htm" target="_blank">Engagement of Institutions in Research</a>, for helpful examples.</p>
    
    </div>

<p>Once the determination (of engagement) has been made, you  should review the section that correlates to your needs, below. Next, you will see that the requirements for  ensuring proper oversight of the activities at the foreign site are divided by  level of research risk (type of VCU IRB review required).</p>

<ol type="A">

  <li><strong><em>Foreign  Institution/Site is <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/assurance/engage.htm" target="_blank">ENGAGED IN THE  RESEARCH</a>:</em></strong>

<p>The principal investigator must ensure that the VCU  IRB submission fully describes how he/she will meet the following additional  requirements (based upon type of IRB review):</p>

  <ol>

    <li>EXEMPT Research*
    
    <p>If the research qualifies for review as exempt, the  following 3 additional requirements apply: </p>

    <ol type="a">

      <li>VCU IRB review and approval is required, including:

      <ol type="i">

        <li>Consultant references  (C.V. with clear description of cultural expertise) must be proposed to the VCU  IRB with the submission for review. This person would serve as a  consultant to the IRB for the purpose of review and should not be otherwise  affiliated with the research. Proposed consultant(s) must demonstrate  knowledge of the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/local.htm" target="_blank">local  research context</a> and perceived level of risk (using the cultural standard of that country). NOTE: Consultant costs are the  responsibility of the submitting principal investigator and should be factored into the cost of conducting the research.</li>

        <li>Translated documents - The principal investigator must be prepared to translate all IRB-approved  documents (intended for distribution to research subjects) using a certified  (or duly qualified) translator. Also,  special requirements may need to be made for an interpreter to facilitate  communication with research participants on an ongoing basis, as necessary. Please see also <a href="XVII-1.htm" target="_blank">VCU IRB XVII-1  Research Subjects with Limited English Proficiency (LEP)</a></li>

        <li>Ongoing Cultural Expertise &ndash; depending upon the interaction with the research subjects, it may be  necessary for a person to collaborate with the research staff on an ongoing  basis to ensure that the research activities are in the best interest of the  community and its members.</li>

        </ol>
        
        </li>

      <li>A letter of permission  must be provided by the foreign institution (that is engaged in the research)  and retained with the compliance records for the study. This letter may be requested by the VCU IRB.</li>

      <li>Other applicable laws of  the foreign country and/or additional requirements of the institution must be  followed, as appropriate (e.g., local IRB review may be required by the foreign  institution, but dual review is not a requirement of the VCU IRB in this case).</li>

      </ol>
      
      </li>

    <li>EXPEDITED Research*

    <p>If the research qualifies for expedited review, the  following 3 additional requirements apply: </p>

    <ol type="a">

      <li>VCU IRB review and approval is required, including:

      <ol type="i">

        <li>Consultant references (C.V. with clear description of cultural expertise) must be proposed to the VCU  IRB with the submission for review.

        </ol>
        
        </li>

      <li><em>Local review is required</em>. The foreign institution may use an Ethics  Board, its own IRB or another IRB able to review on their behalf (in addition  to the VCU IRB review). [NOTE: If the research project involves a DIRECT  FEDERAL award to VCU (or application for such), OHRP requires the foreign institution to have a Federalwide  Assurance (FWA) or obtain one. Please  see OHRP guidance for assisting the foreign institution in obtaining a  Federalwide Assurance and IRB Registration].</li>

      <li>Other applicable laws of  the foreign country and/or additional requirements of the foreign institution  must be followed.</li>

      </ol>

	</li>

    <li>FULL BOARD Research*

    <p>If the research requires a full board review (greater than minimal risk), the following additional requirements apply: </p>

    <ol type="a">

      <li>VCU IRB review and approval is required, including:

      <ol type="i">

        <li>Consultant references  (C.V. with clear description of cultural expertise) must be proposed to the VCU  IRB with the submission for review.
