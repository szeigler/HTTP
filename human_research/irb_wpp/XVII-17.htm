  		<p>All non-exempt research involving human participants supported (funded) by the Department of Education (DoED) or the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDDR) must comply with additional requirements in order to be approved by the IRB. These requirements will hereafter be referred to as DoED requirements. DoED-supported research must be reviewed by the VCU IRB (not an external IRB), regardless of funding source.</p>

                        <li><strong>FERPA: Use of Educational Records</strong> – Access to educational records is regulated by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which stipulates generally that schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student’s education record.

In a K-12 school setting, this letter should typically come from the school superintendent.
