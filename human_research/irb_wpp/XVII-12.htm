  	<p class="style4">Policy Statement</p>

  		<p>All non-exempt research involving human participants supported by the Department of Defense (DoD) must comply with additional requirements established by the DoD in order to be approved by the IRB. DoD-supported research must be reviewed by the VCU IRB (not an external IRB), regardless of funding source (direct or indirect).</p>

	<p class="style4">Definitions</p>

		<p><strong>Classified Research</strong>: Research involving the use or access to information that has been classified as top secret, secret, or confidential as determined by the U.S. Government to prevent unauthorized disclosure for the protection of U.S. citizens, U.S. democratic institutions, homeland security, and U.S. interactions with foreign nations.</p>
    
    	<p><strong>DoD-supported research involving human subjects</strong>: Research involving human subjects for which the Department of Defense is providing at least some of the resources. Resources may include but are not limited to funding through any DoD operation, facilities, equipment, personnel (investigators or other personnel performing tasks identified in the research protocol), providing access to or information about DoD personnel for recruitment, or identifiable data or specimens from living individuals. It includes both DoD-conducted research involving human subjects (intramural research) and research conducted by a non-DoD institution.</p>
    
    	<p class="no_margin"><strong>DoD personnel</strong>: DoD civilian employees and members of the military services.</p>
    
    		<ul class="list_no_bullets">
        		<li><strong>DoD civilian employee</strong>: An individual meeting the definition of “employee”. It includes DoD civilian employees filling full-time, part-time, intermittent, or on-call positions; and individuals serving under personal service contracts.  It excludes employees of contractors (other than personal services contractors) and foreign nationals of host countries.</li>
            
            	<li><strong>DoD service members</strong>: Individuals appointed, enlisted, or inducted for military service under the authority of the Department of Defense. The Military Services are the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and the Reserve Components, which includes the Army and the Air National Guards of the United States. Members of the Reserve Components are included when in a duty status.</li>
      		</ul>
        
  		<p><strong>Research involving human subjects</strong>: Activities that include both a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge AND involve a living individual about whom an investigator conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual or identifiable information.</p>
    
    	<p><strong>Research involving a human being as an experimental subject</strong>: An activity, for research purposes, where there is an intervention or interaction with a living individual for the primary purpose of obtaining data regarding the effect of the intervention or interaction. Research involving a human being as an experimental subject is a subset of research involving human subjects. This definition does not include activities that are not considered research involving human subjects, activities that meet the exemption criteria, and research involving the collection or study of existing data, documents, records, or specimens from living individuals.</p>
    
    	<p><strong>Research monitor</strong>: Individuals with expertise consonant with the nature of risk(s) identified within the research protocol, whose role is to protect the safety and well-being of human subjects.</p>

				<ol type="A">
                	<li><strong>Scientific Merit Review</strong>
                    <p class="no_margin">The IRB must consider the scientific merit of the DoD supported research activity during the IRB review process.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Appointment of a Research Monitor</strong>
                    <p class="no_margin">For research involving more than minimal risk to subjects, an independent research monitor must be appointed by name. Research monitors may be physicians, dentists, psychologists, nurses, or other healthcare providers capable of overseeing the progress of research protocols, especially issues of individual subject/patient management and safety. When research involves a research monitor, the following apply:</p>
                    	<ul type="disc">
                        	<li>The IRB must approve a written summary of the monitor’s duties, authorities, and responsibilities. The IRB shall communicate with research monitors to confirm their duties, authorities, and responsibilities. The duties of the research monitor should be determined on the basis or specific risks or concern about the research. The monitor may perform oversight functions (e.g., observe recruitment, enrollment procedures, and the consent process for individuals, groups or units; oversee study interventions and interactions; review monitoring plans and unanticipated problem reports; and oversee data matching, data collection, and analysis) and report their observations and findings to the IRB or a designated official.</li>
                            <li>Research monitors must be independent of the investigative team.</li>
                            <li>The research monitor should possess sufficient educational and professional experience to serve as the subject/patient advocate. There may be more than one research monitor if different skills or experiences are necessary. The monitor may be an ombudsman or a member of the data safety monitoring board.</li>
                            <li>The research monitor may discuss the research protocol with investigators, interview human subjects, and consult with others outside of the study about the research.</li>
                            <li>The research monitor has the authority to stop a research protocol in progress, remove individual human subjects from a research protocol, and take whatever steps are necessary to protect the safety and well-being of human subjects until the IRB can assess the monitor’s report.</li>
                            <li>The research monitor must promptly report observations and findings to the IRB or other designated official.</li>

                <li><strong>Limitation of waivers and exceptions from informed consent</strong>
                	<p>When research involves human beings as experimental subjects (an intervention or interaction with a living individual for the primary purpose of obtaining data regarding the effect of the intervention or interaction), the IRB may not waive the requirement for informed consent.  The Secretary of Defense may waive the prohibition in this section with respect to a specific project to advance the development of a medical project necessary to the armed forces if the research project may directly benefit the subject and is carried out in accordance with all other applicable laws.</p>
                
                <p>Note: The IRB cannot waive the requirement for informed consent or grant an exception from informed consent for emergency research unless it has documentation that the Secretary of Defense has approved it.</p>
                
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Use of a legally authorized representative to obtain informed consent</strong>
                <p>A legally authorized representative may provide informed consent on a subject’s behalf only when the research is intended to benefit the individual subject.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Research-related Injury</strong>
                <p>When collaborating with a DoD component on greater than minimal risk research, the disclosure for research-related injury should follow the requirements of the collaborating DoD component.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Requirements for Involving DoD Personnel (Service and Civilian) as Subjects</strong>
                	<ul>
                    	<li><strong>Superiors</strong> are prohibited from influencing the decisions of their subordinates regarding participation as subjects in research.</li>
                        <li><strong>Superiors</strong> may not be present at any human subject recruitment sessions or during the consent process in which members of units under their command are afforded the opportunity to participate as human subjects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ombudsman</strong> - When greater than minimal risk research involves Service members as human subjects and when recruitment occurs in a group setting, the IRB must appoint an ombudsman.  The ombudsman should not be associated in any way to the research and will be present during the recruitment in order to monitor that the voluntary involvement or recruitment of the Service members is clearly and adequately stressed and that information provided about the research is clear, adequate and accurate.  The ombudsman may also be the research monitor.</li>
                  	</ul>
              	
                <p>For research involving Service members, determined to be no greater than minimal risk, and when recruitment is occurring in a group setting, the IRB will determine when it is appropriate to appoint an ombudsman for the same purposes.  For research involving civilians as human subjects and when recruitment occurs in a group setting, the IRB will discuss appointing an ombudsman for the purposes described above.  The decision to require the appointment of an ombudsman should be based in part on the human subject population, the consent process, and the recruitment strategy.</p>
           	</li>
            
            <li><strong>Limitations on compensation for U.S. military personnel</strong>
            	<ul type="disc">
                	<li>The Dual Compensation Act prohibits an individual from receiving pay from more than one position for more than an aggregate of 40 hours of work in one calendar week. This prohibition applies to employees paid from either appropriated or non-appropriated funds, or a combination thereof, and includes temporary, part-time and intermittent appointments. This law is not applicable to enlisted off-duty military personnel in relation to their military duty.</li>
                    
                    <li>Human subjects involved in DoD supported research involving human subjects may be compensated for blood draws in the following ways:
                    	<ol type="a">
                        	<li>On-Duty Federal Personnel: may not be compensated for research participation.</li>
                            <li>Off-Duty Federal Personnel: when the research is not federally funded, may be compensated in a reasonable way as determined appropriate by the IRB.</li>
                            <li>Note: DoD3126.02 stipulates that on-duty federal personnel may be compensated in limited circumstances.  It is the policy of the VCU IRB, however, to restrict all compensation for on-duty personnel.</li>
                     	</ol>
                 	</li>
              	</ul>
          	</li>
            
            <li><strong>Survey research requires additional review</strong>
            <p>Surveys of DoD military members and their families and DoD civilian personnel must be approved through the appropriate DoD authority prior to implementation to ensure surveys provide maximum benefits.  Surveys must be administered according to the requirements outlined in OPNAVINST 5300.8C</p>
            
            <p>A Privacy Act Statement must be displayed prominently on all Navy personnel surveys without exception regardless of whether personal identifiers are requested. The statement will identify the authority for survey administration (including OPNAV RCS and expiration date), advise respondents of the purpose and routine uses of the survey, indicate that the survey is voluntary, explain the intended use(s) of the data, and describe measures used to safeguard confidentiality.  The IRB may choose to combine the privacy statement with an informed consent document.</p>

            <li><strong>Provisions for research with human subjects using investigational test articles (drugs, device and biologics)</strong>
            <p>Principal investigators may not be sponsors for INDs and IDEs.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Multi-Site research</strong>
            <p>When conducting multi-site research, a formal agreement between organizations is required to specify the roles and responsibilities of each party.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Classified research </strong>
            <p class="no_margin">When the research activity involves classified information, the following must apply:</p>
            	<ul type="disc">
                	<li>Prior approval from the Secretary of Defense must be obtained.</li>
                    <li>The IRB review must be conducted by the convened panel.  Expedited review is not permissible.</li>
                    <li>Informed consent may not be waived.</li>
                    <li>Informed consent procedures must include:
                    	<ul type="circle" class="no_margin">
                        	<li>Identification of the DoD as the supporting institution of the research, unless the research involves no more than minimal risk.  The Secretary of Defense may waive this requirement.</li>
                            <li>A statement that the research involving human subjects is classified and an explanation of the impact of the classification.</li>
                      	</ul>
                   	</li>
                    <li>The IRB must determine whether potential human subjects need access to classified information to make a valid, informed consent decision.</li>
                    <li>Disclosure or use of classified information complies with the federal requirements for access to and protection of classified information.</li>
                    <li>Any IRB member who disagrees with a majority decision to approve a research activity may appeal the decision to the Secretary of Defense.</li>
