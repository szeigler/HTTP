  	<p class="style4">Policy Statement</p>

		<p>Research involving access or use of protected health information is subject to compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations.  The VCU IRB is designated as a Privacy Board to ensure regulatory compliance requirements are met in the conduct of human participant research.  All research activities involving Protected Health Information (PHI) must implement an appropriate pathway for the use or access as directed in the federal Privacy Rule (45 CFR 160 and 164).</p>

	<p class="style4">Background</p>
    
    	<p>HIPAA, which took effect on April 14, 2003, was developed by the Office of Civil Rights, and became the first-ever federal privacy standards to protect patients' medical records and other health information provided to health plans, doctors, hospitals and other health care providers.  These standards provide patients with access to their medical records and more control over how their personal health information is used and disclosed. They represent a uniform, federal floor of privacy protections for consumers across the country, specifically protecting medical records and other individually identifiable health information, whether it is on paper, in computers or communicated orally.  The Privacy Rule is codified in 45 CFR 160 and 164.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Points</h4>
        	<ul>
            	<li>HIPAA Regulations protect a subset of individually identifiable information, known as Protected Health Information (PHI) from inappropriate disclosure.</li>
                <li>HIPAA Regulations only protect individually identifiable health information that is held or maintained by covered entities or their business associates that create, use or receive such information in a health care context.</li>
                <li>The HIPAA regulations specifically address the use of protected health information for research purposes.</li>
          	</ul>

	<p class="style4">Definitions</p>
    
    	<p class="no_margin"><strong>VCU Affiliated Covered Entity (VCU ACE)</strong>: VCU and VCUHS are jointly covered by HIPAA regulations under what is termed the VCU Affiliated Covered Entity (VCU ACE). All of the units included in the VCU ACE may have access to Protected Health Information through the conduct of standard business operations. The VCU ACE includes the following units:</p>
        	<ul>
            	<li>VCU Health System (VCUHS) and all satellite clinics</li>

	<p class="style4" style="margin-top:1em;">Procedures and Guidance</p>
    
    	<p class="no_margin">In order to utilize PHI in connection with research, researchers must access PHI through one of the following pathways:</p>
        	<ul>
            	<li>Signed, written authorization from research participants;</li>
                <li>Waiver of the authorization from the VCU IRB or Western IRB;</li>
                <li>Partial waiver of authorization for recruitment from the VCU IRB or Western IRB;</li>
                <li>Limited data set in conjunction with a data use agreement;</li>
                <li>Review preparatory to research for research feasibility;</li>
                <li>De-Identified data; or</li>
                <li>Research on decedent's information.</li>
           	</ul>
            
      	<h4>Signed Authorization</h4>
        	<ol type="1">
            	<li>Signed authorization is the standard mechanism for accessing or using PHI in research.  The Authorization describes risks to privacy and explains how, why and to whom PHI may be used or disclosed.  When signing an authorization, research participants are directly authorizing the use of their PHI for research purposes.  Generally, whenever informed consent is obtained, signed Authorization should be obtained.  Researchers may choose to either:
                	<ol type="a" style="margin-bottom:1em;">
                    	<li>Combine the Authorization and the Informed Consent into a single document; or</li>
                        <li>Utilize separate Informed Consent and Authorization documents.</li>
                  	</ol>
                    
              	<p>Templates for both options are available on the IRB website (see references below).</p>
              	</li>
                
                <li>HIPAA regulations require that authorization documents contain specific elements and statements.  VCU researchers can ensure all of the requirements are being met by utilizing one of the template options.  The required elements of Authorization are:
                	<ol type="a" style="margin-bottom:1em;">
                    	<li>Specific description of the PHI to be used or disclosed.</li>
                        <li>Names or other specific identification of the person(s) or class of persons authorized to release the PHI (e.g., the covered entity).</li>
                        <li>Names or other specific identification of the person(s) or class of persons to whom the PHI will be released to (e.g., PI).</li>
                        <li>The purpose for using the PHI (e.g., purpose of the research).</li>
                        <li>Expiration date or event for when use is no longer authorized (for research this may be “end of the study” or “none” in cases where a research registry will be maintained).</li>
                        <li>Statement of the individual’s right to revoke the authorization and how to do so, as well as any exceptions to the right to revoke.</li>
                        <li>Statement indicating whether treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility of benefits can be conditioned on authorization, including research-related treatment and consequences of refusing to sign the authorization.</li>
                        <li>Statement of the potential risk that PHI will be re-disclosed by the researcher, and indicating that the disclosed PHI may no longer be protected under the Privacy Rule.</li>
                        <li>Signature and date of the individual.  If a legally authorized representative signs, the authorization must include a description of the representative’s authority to act for the individual.</li>
                   	</ol>
               	</li>
                
                <li><p>When combining authorization with informed consent and the consent includes optional activities, such as a research registry for future use, the HIPAA authorization must make it clear that the subject is not required to provide authorization for both the primary research activity and the registry.</p></li>
                
                <li>Submission for Approval:
                	<ol type="a" style="margin-bottom:1em;">
                    	<li>As applicable, investigators should submit an Informed Consent document containing authorization elements OR a separate Authorization document with applications to the IRB.</li>

              	</li>

                	<ol type="a" class="no_margin">
                    	<li>The VCU IRB will determine whether signed Authorization is the appropriate HIPAA pathway.</li>
                        <li>When Authorization is combined with the Informed Consent, the IRB will approve the entire document.</li>
                        <li>When the Authorization is a separate document, the IRB will ensure the document has been submitted but will not review the content of the Authorization.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring the authorization contains all required elements.</li>
                        <li>The approved HIPAA pathway(s) will be documented in the IRB approved smart form in RAMS-IRB.</li>

        	<ol type="1">
            	<li><p>A Waiver of Authorization is a mechanism to use or disclose PHI for research purposes when obtaining a signed Authorization is not feasible.  A Privacy Board or an IRB designated as a Privacy Board must approve a Waiver of Authorization.  The VCU IRB and Western IRB have authority to approve Waivers of Authorization.  Generally, a Waiver of Authorization is approvable if a Waiver of Informed Consent is approvable.</p></li>

                            	<li>The use or disclosure of the PHI involves no more than minimal risk (an expedited review) to the privacy of individuals based on, at least, the presence of the following:
                                	<ol type="1" class="no_margin">
                                    	<li>An adequate plan to protect health information identifiers from improper use and disclosure.</li>
                                        <li>An adequate plan to destroy identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent with the conduct of the research.</li>

		<h4>Partial Waiver of Authorization for Recruitment</h4>
        	<ol type="1">
            	<li><p>A Partial Waiver of Authorization is required by VCU when researchers wish to identify a pool of potential research participants for recruitment purposes by searching medical records within the VCU ACE.  The intent of the Partial Waiver of Authorization is to allow researchers to access individual’s PHI for recruitment.  With a Partial Waiver of Authorization for Recruitment, if an individual decides to enroll in a study, full signed Authorization should be sought from the individual prior to beginning study procedures.  The signed Authorization indicates permission for further use of PHI for the conduct of the study.  When it is not practicable to obtain a signature on an Authorization document (e.g., when a study has an approved waiver of documentation of consent), then a partial waiver of the authorization (to waive the signature) should also be sought (see below).</p></li>

            <h4>Minimum Necessary</h4>
            <p>HIPAA regulations require that investigators access and use only the minimum PHI necessary to conduct the research.  Principal investigators should consider exactly what PHI is required for each study and only request what is absolutely necessary.</p>
            
            <h4>Document Retention</h4>
            <p>HIPAA regulations require that study documents pertaining to HIPAA covered research be maintained for a minimum of 6 years past the date of study closure with the IRB.</p>
            
            <h4>Breach of PHI</h4>
            <p>In situations where PHI is disclosed or possibly disclosed to unauthorized individuals or entities (e.g., unencrypted USB drive is stolen or lost), the event must be reported to the IRB as an Unanticipated Problem (Prompt Report).  The possible breach must also be reported to the Privacy Office.   Reporting such an event is critically important, as the institution has certain legal obligations that must be fulfilled in the event of a breach of PHI.</p>
