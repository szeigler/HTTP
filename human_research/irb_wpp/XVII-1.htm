  <p class="style4">Objective</p>

<p>To provide guidance for VCU clinical investigators regarding obtaining and documenting informed consent and ensuring ongoing informed consent for subjects with Limited English Proficiency (LEP).</p>

<p class="style4">Description</p>

<p>For the purpose of this policy, research participants with  Limited English Proficiency (LEP) include any persons who cannot read or  otherwise do not have full access to or understanding of English. A  language barrier may make it difficult to ensure that subjects fully understand  the risks or benefits of participation.</p>

<p>The governing principles of human subject research - respect  for persons, beneficence, and justice - require that researchers not exclude  potential subjects based solely on a limited ability to read, hear, speak, or  otherwise understand English. The investigator is to fully consider that not only clinical criteria determine study eligibility. If the subject's probability and magnitude of  risk of participation is great because of language constraints, the prospective subject may not be considered eligible for the study. Depending on the nature of the study, as well  as available language and participant support, it may be in the best interests of a prospective subject with LEP (and other subjects on the study) to NOT be  enrolled, even if he or she is eligible by clinical criteria. However, in most cases, enrolling subjects with LEP is encouraged. </p>

<ol type="A">

  <li><strong><em>Involving Persons with LEP in Research:</em></strong>

  <p>There are three scenarios for involving participants with LEP in a research study.  Each scenario is further elaborated in subsequent sections of this WPP.</p>

  <ol>

    <li>Planned involvement of subjects with LEP, either targeting a known LEP population(s) or  anticipating that persons with LEP may be eligible and interested in  participating. Such planned involvement  may be part of the initial submission or is reconsidered and submitted as a  Change in Research. (Section A below).</li>

    <li>An occasional, unanticipated person with LEP may be eligible for a study and wants  to participate. In many cases this  scenario will involve therapeutic research, where the research holds the  prospect of providing direct benefit to the subject and there is time to submit  a Change in Research to the IRB for prospective approval. (Section B below)</li>

    <li>An unanticipated person with LEP is eligible to participate in a therapeutic study  for which the initiation of study interventions is urgent. Due to the urgent need to enroll a person in  the study, prior IRB review may not be possible. (Section C below)</li>

    </ol>

</li>

<li><strong><em>Planned Involvement of Research Participants with LEP</em></strong>

  <p>Elements to be considered and included within the protocol for planned involvement of persons  with LEP are:</p>

  <ol>

    <li>Do you feel that the risks of participation during the course of the study  (including the added risks associated with having Limited English Proficiency) are balanced with the anticipated benefits, if any?</li>

    <li>Describe how persons with LEP will be identified and recruited for the study, how will  research team interact with LEP participants?</li>

    <li>Provide translations of all documents, including the informed consent form, which will  be given to the subjects. Alternatively (and recommended), first submit documents in English only. After they have been approved, submit the  translated documents with a Change in Research form to the IRB for approval. Translated documents must have  IRB approval before being used. See  Section E below for more information on translated documents.</li>

    <li>How  will the initial informed consent process be handled? Will there be a qualified interpreter or assistive devices available? Describe how to handle the consent process if the person with LEP is illiterate in his or her language. See Section D below for information on interpreters.</li>

    <li>How will ongoing research study visits be handled? Will an interpreter be  present? How will impromptu questions be handled?</li>

  </ol>
  
  </li>

  <li><p>Unanticipated, non-urgent, enrollment of a subject with LEP where a Change in Research is  submitted to the IRB prospectively (research intervention is not urgent)</p>

  <p>Elements to consider and include within a Change in  Research submission for the unanticipated enrollment of an eligible individual with LEP where there is time to submit to the IRB for prospective approval: </p>

  <ol>

    <li>Do you feel that the risks of participation during the course of the study  (including the added risks associated with having Limited English Proficiency) are balanced with the anticipated benefits, if any?</li>

    <li>Describe how eligibility will be ascertained and recruitment handled.</li>

    <li>IRB approved documents that are provided to subjects must be translated into the  subject&rsquo;s language. More information on  translation of documents is found in Section E below.</li>

    <li>How will the initial informed consent process be handled? Will there be a qualified interpreter or assistive devices available?</li>

    <li>How will ongoing research study visits be handled? Will an interpreter be  present? How will impromptu questions  or reports of adverse events be handled?</li>

  </ol>
  
  </li>

  <li><p>Unanticipated, urgent, enrollment of an eligible subject with LEP when research intervention  must begin as soon as possible</p>

  <p>45 CFR 46.117(b)(2) and 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2) provide  for a &lsquo;short form&rsquo; process for the informed consent, in which there is an oral summary  presentation of the informed consent in conjunction with a short form written consent document stating that the required elements of the full consent have  been presented orally. The &lsquo;short form&rsquo;, although originally intended to  address the needs of subjects with English illiteracy, is used by many IRBs for  unplanned enrollment of individuals with LEP whose clinical needs require an  urgent initiation of the research interventions. The VCU IRB does not encourage use of the  short form process, maintaining that LEP subjects have the right to full and  complete disclosure of a research protocol so that they may make a fully  informed decision about whether to participate. However, the VCU IRB will  consider the use of the &lsquo;short form&rsquo; process in cases of &lsquo;urgent medical need,&rsquo;  where the intervention is not available outside of the research context and  time is of the essence. In this case, it is highly recommended that the  investigator notify the VCU IRB when an eligible research participant appears to have LEP. The investigator&rsquo;s clinical expertise is a crucial  determinant of whether the research intervention is urgent, in which case, the  following elements must be carried out by the investigator and research team: Through the &lsquo;short form&rsquo; process,  the principal investigator is responsible for:</p>

  <ol>

    <li>Identifying when an eligible research participant is a person with LEP.</li>

    <li>Identifying one or more persons, such as family members or others, who are conversant in  the subject&rsquo;s language and English. Although family members are ethically inappropriate primary  interpreters, because of concerns about privacy and coercion, they may function  as witnesses to the consent process. In  some cases, the presence of family support is necessary to help the subject  understand the requirements of the study in order to facilitate compliance and  safety during the course of the study. The primary interpretor acts to translate interactions during the informed consent discussion.</li>

    <li>Consulting the regulations at <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm#46.117" target="_blank">45 CFR 46.117</a>(b)(2) and <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRsearch.cfm?CFRPart=50" target="_blank">21 CFR 50.27</a> (b)(2) for requirements relative to the &lsquo;short form&rsquo; process.</li>

    <li>Locating a short form template from the OHRP guidance memo <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/ic-non-e.htm" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp; (OBTAINING AND DOCUMENTING INFORMED CONSENT  OF SUBJECTS WHO DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH) and ensuring that it is translated into  the necessary language and is properly done so by a qualified translator (not a  friend or family member). See Section E  below for information about translation.</li>

    <li>Providing a translated &lsquo;short form&rsquo; and summary to the IRB for approval by the Chair or  designee BEFORE they can be implemented.&nbsp;  A summary of the oral presentation given to the subject need not be  translated. In most cases, the IRB  recommends that the English informed consent document serve as the &lsquo;summary&rsquo; in  the short form process. </li>

    <li>Involving a qualified interpreter in the oral presentation of the informed consent form or summary and short form to the subject. The interpreter answers questions as they arise at the time of consent and ideally on an ongoing basis throughout study participation.</li>

    <li>Ensuring a presence of at least one bilingual witness to the oral presentation not associated with the study. This can be a family member. The investigator should  be present to answer questions during the oral presentation.</li>

    <li>Providing a fully translated version of the complete informed consent form to the IRB within no more than 2 weeks of utilizing the short form on a subject. (See  Section E below). In addition, the Research Plan should be modified to reflect  the enrollment of LEP subject(s) and submitted to the IRB. Once approved by the IRB, the subject or LAR  should read the consent form in the presence of an interpreter and continued consent should be documented.</li>

    </ol>

  <p><em>REMINDER: For cases where therapeutic research intervention is not urgent, the VCU IRB reminds  investigators that research subjects may often gain access to investigational  therapies &ldquo;off protocol&rdquo; where no data is collected for research  purposes. This is an alternative to consider if the above requirements  (in sections A and B) prohibit the involvement of the subject in research that  might involve access to investigational therapies.</em></p>

</li>

  <li><p>The Use of a Qualified Medical Interpreter (for oral presentation): In some cases, the medical and technical information  discussed during the initial consent discussion (and throughout the course of participation) can be complex and should be communicated to LEP subjects through an interpreter with training and understanding in medical terminology, as well as understanding of cultural contexts. The use of a qualified medical interpreter is of greater importance in research where the risks to the subject are great. If the research involves potentially sensitive matters and/or health information, the qualified medical interpreter must be an individual with a professional commitment to maintain strict confidentiality. Ideally, the interpreter may also function as a participant advocate throughout the study, not only during the initial consent process. The interpretor may be  able to assist the subject ask questions and understand ongoing study-related communication.</p>

  <p>VCU offers a CyraCom interpretor system in the  in-patient clinical setting which may not be adequate for high risk, complex research. VCUHS Language Services may be contacted for assistance regarding interpreter  and translation needs in the clinical research setting.-- </p>

  <p>The VCU IRB provides the following questions to consider when working with medical interpreters:</p>

  <ol>

    <li>How  will the investigator and interpreter determine whether the subject truly  understands the consent information? The PI may consider using questions  from the VCU Informed Consent Evaluation Instrument [<a href="../ICEval.doc" target="_blank">here</a>] and asked by the interpreter to ascertain whether the LEP participant has  understood the informed consent explanation. </li>

    <li>Informed  consent is an ongoing process. How will the investigator ensure that the  subject will understand ongoing study-related communication? If the subject has questions about continuing in the study, how will that be communicated  to researchers?</li></ol>

</li>

  <li><strong><em>The  Use of a Certified or Duly Qualified Translation Specialist (for written  documents):</em></strong>

  <p>The initial informed consent document and other  written material must be provided to the prospective research subject in the  language that is most understandable to them. As such, a reliable method  for translating documents is imperative.</p>

  <p>The following points describe the most expeditious  process for approval of a foreign language consent document for scenarios  related to planned or non-urgent involvement of persons with LEP:</p>

  <ol>

    <li>The initial research protocol/plan or Change in Research submission to the VCU IRB  must reflect methods for assuring full understanding of the person having LEP, as required by the VCU IRB at time of initial review or following the  identification of a communication need with a prospective subject.</li>

    <li>The English version of the informed consent documents and any other  written/audio/video materials should be submitted to, and approved, by the VCU  IRB prior to the translation of the document.</li>

    <li>When all documents submitted in English meet the approval of the VCU IRB, an  approval letter will be issued, excluding persons with LEP from participation.</li>

    <li>The involvement of the persons with LEP will be permitted only after certified, or  duly qualified, translations have been submitted to the VCU IRB that are based  upon the IRB-approved material. IRB approval of certified, or duly  qualified translations means that the IRB has approved the English version of  the informed consent documents, determined the credentials of the translator  are acceptable, and there is no conflict of interest for the translator.</li>

    </ol>

  <p>The VCU IRB provides the following additional guidance regarding working with translation professionals:</p>


<ol>

  <li>A certified translation may include a notarized  statement by the translator that he/she understands English and the target  language and may list the translator&rsquo;s credentials. A copy of the  certification should be attached to the translation. If the investigator  obtains a certified translation, he/she is not required to provide a back translation.</li>

  <li>A back translation by a second individual is required by the IRB if: a) the study is biomedical  research greater than minimal risk , b) the study is very complex, c) no certified translation is available, or d) the qualifications of the translator are in question. In this case, the back  translation by a person unaffiliated with the research should also be provided to the VCU IRB as proof of the quality of the translation (though, it is  understood that the back translation may differ from the English version due to  variations in the way that certain cultures structure sentences and convey concepts, however ALL the information must be included).</li>

  <li>A duly qualified translator (one without official  certification) may be used in minimal  risk research or if the research is highly specialized. Appropriate  translator credentials may include: a) a  native speaker of the target language, b) experience living where the language  is spoken, or c) college-level preparation in the language. The IRB will determine if the credentials of  the duly qualified translator are sufficient, given the nature of the research.</li>

  <li>The cost related to services of a certified, or  duly qualified, translation professional is the investigator&rsquo;s  responsibility. These costs may be quite high, particularly for large  studies where multiple language translations are needed. These costs are  generally paid by sponsors if included in the budget by the investigator.</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p class="style4">Responsibility</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the principal investigator to anticipate non-English speaking or subjects with LEP and to make every effort to ensure legally effective consent if the subject is to be enrolled. </p>
