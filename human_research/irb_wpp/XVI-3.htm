  <p class="style4">Objective</p>

<p>To describe the process for emergency use of investigational drugs, devices, or biologics.</p>

<p class="style4">Description</p>

<p>Emergency use of unapproved drugs or biologics is research under the FDA regulations. As such, the emergency use of a test article, other than a medical device, is considered a clinical investigation by the FDA and the patient is a participant. The FDA may require data from an emergency use to be reported in a marketing application.</p>

<p>Conversely, DHHS regulations stipulate that patients receiving a test article in an emergency use situation may not be considered a research participant. Thus, this activity is not considered research at VCU that is subject to prior IRB review and approval.  As the activity is not research, the outcome of such treatment may not be included in any report of research activity subject to DHHS regulations. However, comprehensive records must be retained regarding the administration and monitoring of this unapproved article. Standard IRB reporting requirements and deadlines apply as well as any sponsor-requirements for monitoring and sharing safety information. Emergency use of a test article may not be used to circumvent the general requirement for prior IRB review and approval.</p>

<ol type="A">

  <li><em><strong>Definitions:</strong></em>

  <ol type="1" start="1">

    <li><em>Emergency use</em> is defined as the use of an investigational drug or biological product with a  human subject in a life-threatening situation in  which no standard acceptable treatment is available and in which there is not  sufficient time to obtain IRB approval [21 CFR 56.102(d)]. Every effort should be made to attempt to  obtain prior IRB review and approval (where possible). However, the FDA regulations do not provide  for expedited IRB review in emergency situations. Therefore,  &quot;interim,&quot; &quot;compassionate,&quot; &quot;temporary&quot; or other  terms for an expedited approval process are not applicable.</li>

    <li><em>An unapproved medical device</em> is defined as a device that is used for a purpose or condition  for which the device requires, but does not have, an approved application for premarket approval under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic  Act [21 U.S.C. 360(e)]. An unapproved device may be used in human subjects only  if it is approved for clinical testing under an approved application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act [21  U.S.C. 360(j)(g)] and 21 CFR part 812. Medical devices that have not received  marketing clearance under section 510(k) of the FD&amp;C Act are also  considered unapproved devices which require an IDE. The Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) recognizes that emergencies arise where an unapproved  device may offer the only possible life-saving alternative, but an IDE for the  device does not exist, or the proposed use is not approved under an existing  IDE, or the physician or institution is not approved under the IDE. In these instances, justification to the FDA, that the emergency existed, is  subsequently required.

    <li class="no_margin"><em>Life-threatening</em>,  for the purposes of section 56.102(d), includes the scope of both  life-threatening and severely debilitating, as defined below.

      <ol type="a" class="no_margin">

        <li><em>Life-threatening</em> means diseases or conditions where the likelihood of death is high unless the  course of the disease is interrupted and diseases or conditions with  potentially fatal outcomes, where the end point of clinical trial analysis is  survival. The criteria for life-threatening do not require the condition to be  immediately life-threatening or to immediately result in death. Rather, the  subjects must be in a life-threatening situation requiring intervention before  review at a convened meeting of the IRB is feasible.</li>

        <li><em>Severely debilitating</em> means diseases or conditions that cause major irreversible morbidity. Examples  of severely debilitating conditions include blindness, loss of arm, leg, hand  or foot, loss of hearing, paralysis or stroke.</li>

      </ol>
      
      </li>

    <li><em>Emergency Use  Provision:</em> The &quot;Emergency  Use Provision&quot; in the FDA regulations [21 CFR 56.104(c)] is an exemption  from prior review and approval by the IRB. The exemption, which may not be used  unless all of the conditions described in 21 CFR 56.102(d) exist, allows for  one emergency use of a test article without prospective IRB review. FDA  regulations require that any subsequent use of the investigational product at  the institution have prospective IRB review and approval. FDA acknowledges, however, that it would be inappropriate to deny emergency treatment to a second individual if the only obstacle is that the IRB has not had sufficient time to  convene a meeting to review the issue.</li>

</ol>

</li>

  <li><em><strong>Conditions for the Emergency Use Provision (Exemption from Prior Review):</strong></em>

  <ol type="1"><li>Prospective IRB Review Not Possible: If full board VCU IRB review and approval is  possible, the responsible individual (medical professional) should pursue the  prospective IRB review. ONLY IF  treatment of a life-threatening condition is necessary before the IRB approval is made, does the Emergency Use Provision (Exemption from Prior IRB Review and  Approval) apply. </li>

  <li><p>IND Required for Drugs/Biologics: The  emergency use of an unapproved investigational drug or biologic requires an  IND. If the intended subject does not meet the inclusion criteria of an  existing study protocol, or if an approved study protocol does not exist, the  usual procedure is to contact the manufacturer and determine if the drug or  biologic can be made available for the emergency use under the manufacturer&rsquo;s  IND.</p>

    <p>The need for an investigational drug or biologic  may arise in an emergency situation that does not allow time for submission of  an IND or amendment of the manufacturer&rsquo;s IND. In such a case, only the FDA may authorize  shipment of the test article in advance of the IND submission (or amendment). Requests for  such authorization may be made by telephone or other rapid communication means to the FDA [21 CFR 312.36].</li>

  <li>Informed Consent Required: Even for an emergency use, the physician is required to obtain informed  consent of the patient or the patient's legally authorized representative unless both the treatment physician and a physician who is not  otherwise participating in the patient&rsquo;s care certify in writing all of the  following [21 CFR 50.23(a)]:

    <ol type="a" class="no_margin">

      <li>The subject is confronted by a life-threatening situation necessitating the use of the test article. </li>

      <li>Informed consent cannot be obtained because of an inability to communicate with, or obtain legally effective consent from, the  subject. </li>

      <li>Time is not sufficient to obtain consent from the subject's legal representative. </li>

      <li>No alternative method of approved or generally recognized therapy is available that provides an equal or greater likelihood of saving the subject's life.</li>

    </ol>
    
    </li>

  <li>PROMPT IRB Reporting Required: If, in the physician's opinion, immediate use  of the test article is required to preserve the subject's life, and if time is  not sufficient to obtain an independent physician's determination that the four  conditions above apply, the clinical investigator should make the determination  and, within 5 working days after the use of the  article, have the determination reviewed and evaluated in writing by a  physician who is not participating in the clinical investigation. The physician  must notify the IRB within 5 working days after the use of the test article [21  CFR 50.23(c)].</li>

  </ol>
  
  </li>

  <li><em><strong>VCU IRB Required Reporting/Review Procedures:</strong></em>

  <p>In order to exercise the Emergency Use Provision (for Exemption from Prior IRB Review), the following procedures must be  followed:</p>

<ol type="1">

  <li><em>Pre-Emergency Use Notification: </em>The physician seeking to provide life-saving treatment with an investigational  drug, device, or biologic should notify the VCU IRB that he or she is prepared  to exercise the &quot;Emergency Use Provision&quot; (where possible, using any  available means, such as fax, phone, email, or other method). This notification should not be construed as an IRB approval. Rather, the VCU IRB uses the prior notification to initiate tracking to ensure that the investigator files a report within the five day time-frame required by 21 CFR 56.104(c).</li>

  <li><em>Pre-Emergency Use Research  Participant Protections:</em> VCU  requires that the physician authorizing the use of the device follow as many  subject protection procedures as possible, including:

      <ul class="no_margin">

        <li>obtaining an independent assessment by an  uninvolved physician; </li>

        <li>obtaining informed consent from the patient or a  legal representative; </li>

        <li>notifying institutional officials as specified  by clinical/institutional policies; </li>

        <li>notifying the VCU Institutional Review Board  (IRB); AND</li>

        <li>obtaining authorization from the IND/IDE holder  (as appropriate).</li>

        </ul>
        
        </li>

<li><em>Post-Emergency Use Report:</em> Following the treatment of an individual  under the &quot;Emergency Use Provision&quot; the treating physician must  justify the &quot;Emergency Use&quot;, as follows:

      <ul class="no_margin">

        <li>Describe how the individual treated was in a life-threatening situation in which no standard  acceptable treatment was available and in which there was not sufficient time  to obtain VCU IRB approval; </li>

        <li>Document when contact was made to the IRB and what  information was transmitted;</li>

        <li>Justify why prospective IRB review was not possible;</li>

        <li>Identify how the requirements for an IND were met (if applicable - see several  options, above); and </li>

        <li>Identify the informed consent process used (see  options, above).</li>

        </ul>
        
        </li>

	<li><em>Subsequent Use:</em> Any  subsequent use of the test article is subject to prospective VCU IRB review. </li>

	<li><em>IRB Chairperson Review:</em> The IRB chairperson ( or knowledgeable  designee) will review reports of &quot;Emergency Use&quot; both prospective  reports and retrospective reports) to determine whether the circumstances meet  the regulatory requirement and to determine whether informed consent was obtained or waived in accordance with FDA regulations.</li>

  <li><em>Concerns:</em> If the Chairperson has concerns regarding failure to follow regulations, the matter will be referred to the  OECO in accordance with the VCU IRB WPP#: VI-3.</li>

</ol>

</li>

  <li><em><strong>Special Issues: </strong></em>

  <ol type="1">

    <li>The FDA notes that in the event that a device is to be used in circumstances  meeting the criteria listed above, the device developer must notify the Center  for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), Program Operation Staff by  telephone (301-594-1190) immediately after shipment is made. [Note: an  unapproved device may not be shipped in anticipation of an emergency.] Nights  and weekends, contact the Division of Emergency and Epidemiological Operations  (202-857-8400).</li>

    <li>Some manufacturers will agree to allow the use of the test article, but their policy  requires &quot;an IRB approval letter&quot; before the test article will be  shipped. If it is not possible to convene a quorum of the IRB within the time  available, the VCU IRB may send the sponsor a written statement that the IRB is  aware of the proposed use and considers the use to meet the requirements of 21  CFR 56.104(c). Although, this is not an &quot;IRB approval,&quot; the  acknowledgment letter has been acceptable to manufacturers and has allowed the  shipment to proceed. </li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p class="style4">Responsibility</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the treating physician/practitioner to determine if emergency use of an unapproved drug, device, or biologic is of medical necessity and to take the pre-use and post-use actions described above, including reporting the use to the IRB within 5 working days.</p>
