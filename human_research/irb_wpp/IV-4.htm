Each Panel Chairperson is responsible for conducting the panel’s meetings in an efficient and orderly fashion with respect given to the opinions of all members.  Robert's Rules of Order may be used as a guidebook for conducting the meeting.  Each Panel Chairperson serves as primary signatory official for that panel’s IRB correspondence.

Should neither the chairperson nor the vice chairperson be available, either may designate a senor board member to assume his/her responsibilities during the period of absence.</p>

                <li><strong>IRB Leadership and Enhancement Committee (ILEC):</strong>
                <p>The ILEC provides leadership for the VCU IRB system by working to enhance the IRB policies and processes and promoting consistency among IRB Panels.  While each IRB panel acts independently for reviews, they are each governed by the same VCU policies and procedures, in addition to state and Federal regulations.  This Committee will meet regularly to discuss issues related to the function of the VCU IRBs and their relationship with the research enterprise.  It will serve as the central contact point for individual researchers, programs, institutes and the community who inquire about the VCU IRB policies and procedures.  The ILEC will strive for consensus among the Chairs and Vice-Chairs in an effort to arrive at consistency, as possible, across Panels.  The ILEC will have final approval over adoption of new or substantive revisions of IRB processes, WPPs, submission forms (as they pertain to PI and/or IRB member responsibilities) via the ILEC Chair.</p>
                	<ol type="1" class="no_margin">
                    	<li><p>Membership of the ILEC is comprised of the ILEC Chair, IRB Panel Chairs and Vice Chairs, the Directors of the ORSP and ORIE, a representative of the CCTR, and a non-affiliate member of an IRB panel, if possible.  In addition, 3 faculty members and one clinical research coordinator with experience conducting human subjects research are appointed to serve on the ILEC.  In an effort to provide university-wide representation, these appointments are made by recommendation of the Vice President for Research, Vice President for Health Sciences, and the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost.</p></li>
                        <li>Responsibilities of the ILEC include:
