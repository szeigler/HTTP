  <p class="style4">Objective</p>

  <p>To describe the policies and procedures of the VCU IRB  pertaining to the VCU IRB appeal process.</p>

<p class="style4">Description</p>

<p>It is the IRB&rsquo;s primary charge to protect human subjects  while adhering to federal and state regulations and university policies and  procedures. In so doing, an IRB panel  may require changes necessary to secure approval which are not congruent with  investigators&rsquo; planned procedures or documents. It is, therefore, critical that each step of the review process involve  an open discussion and negotiation between the investigators and the IRB panel  (informal discussions and consultations should occur as necessary). Directors of ORSP and ORCE, the Senior IRB  Chair, the Panel Chair, and the IRB Leadership and Enhancement Committee serve  as resources for investigators and reviewers throughout the review of a  protocol. </p>

<ol type="A">

  <li><strong><em>Appeal Process</em></strong> (also see flowchart at the end of this WPP):

  <p>For exempt and expedited reviews: The reviewer will work with the investigator  to resolve issues. If resolution is  unsuccessful, the issue will be referred to the Full Board for formal  discussion and deliberation. (For issues  involving review by the Exempt Panel, the protocol will be scheduled for review  by a fully-constituted IRB Panel). The  investigator will receive a formal letter documenting the outcome of Panel  deliberation and may also, as appropriate, be contacted by email or phone by  the reviewer(s) or Chair/Vice Chair. The  reviewers and Chair should work with the investigator to achieve a plan that  meets both the study&rsquo;s needs while adhering to the ethics of human subjects  protection, federal regulations, and VCU policies and procedures. The panel or investigator may request an  informal discussion of the issue with the Senior Chair, IRB Leadership and  Enhancement Committee, or Directors of the ORCE or ORSP.</p>

  <p><em>For full  board reviews:</em> If a protocol is  tabled or disapproved at the IRB Panel meeting, the investigator should work  with the reviewers and, as needed, the Chair to resolve identified issues. The investigator may be invited to attend the  next meeting after the protocol is resubmitted with changes. At that time the panel can discuss with the  investigator any unresolved issues and obtain clarifications as needed. The investigator will be asked to step out of  the meeting during the Panel discussion and voting process, but will be invited  back into the room to answer additional questions and to receive the verbal  report of the Panel&rsquo;s determination. If  the investigator and Panel cannot reach an agreement the investigator may  contact the IRB Leadership and Enhancement Committee and request an  appeal.</p>

</li>

  <li><strong><em>Appeal Procedures:</em></strong>

  <p>The investigator will complete a VCU IRB Appeal  Form outlining the decision(s) being appealed and providing information  supporting his or her position. The form  will be reviewed by the Senior Chair and referred to the IRB Leadership and  Enhancement Committee Appeal Process. </p>

  <p>The Director of the ORCE will serve as Chair for  the Appeals Committee. The Appeals  Committee will be comprised of the following voting members: Chairs/Vice Chairs from the uninvolved  Panels, a non affiliate member from one of the IRB panels not involved with the  review under appeal, the GCRC patient advocate, the Director of the ORSP, and a  member to be selected by the investigator. This member, if possible, will be chosen from current or past IRB  members, and, unless they are a non-affiliated member of an IRB panel, he/she  must be a VCU employee. A minimum of 6  voting individuals must be present at the meeting. Unless waived by the investigator, the voting  member selected by the investigator must be present (in person or via  telephone) at the meeting. The IO may  be present at the meeting as an observer and may provide information relevant  to the appeal, but is not a voting member. </p>

  <p>At the meeting, the committee will focus on the  unresolved issue(s), but will review the issue(s) in the context of the entire  project. The investigator will present  the protocol and issue(s) at hand.  Consultants (as approved by the Chair of the Appeals Committee) may be  invited to present relevant information, background, or precedent in regard to  the issue(s). The Panel Chair/Vice Chair and/or Panel reviewers will present  relevant information from the Panel&rsquo;s prior discussions and decisions. After hearing the information and reviewing  the documents, the investigator(s), consultants and those not a part of the  Appeals Committee will be excused for the discussion and voting by the  Committee.</p>

  <p>The Appeals Committee will reach a final decision  by majority vote to either agree or disagree with the IRB panel decision  regarding the procedure, wording, or plan as proposed by the investigator. The following decisions may be rendered by  the Appeals Committee:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>If  the Appeals Committee disagrees with the decision of the IRB Panel, the  protocol will be transferred to another IRB Panel for full review.</li>

    <li>If  the Appeals Committee is in agreement, the decision of the IRB Panel of record  will stand. For example, if the original  decision involved disapproval of the entire protocol, and the Appeals Committee  is in agreement with the original decision, the protocol will continue to be  disapproved by the IRB. The investigator may submit a new protocol with major  revisions, aimed at resolving the human subjects&rsquo; issue(s), if disapproval  occurred at initial review.</li>

    <li>If  the decision involves only a portion of the protocol (for example,  recruitment), or a modification to a previously approved protocol, the Appeals  Committee will refer the protocol back to the IRB Panel of record for  review. The investigator or panel may  request that the study be referred to another Panel. The Appeals Committee will have final  decision regarding transfer of the protocol to a new Panel.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>In all cases, the findings of the Appeals Committee  will be provided to the investigator and IRB Panel(s) in writing. The Institutional Official and  investigator&rsquo;s Chairperson will be copied on the written communication. The minutes and the letter will become part  of the IRB file.</p>

  <p>All decisions by the Appeals Committee are final  and cannot be appealed. The IO can not  reverse a disapproval by an IRB Panel nor reverse the agreement with that  disapproval by the Appeals Committee. However, if the Appeals Committee disagrees with the original IRB panel  and the study is referred to another panel which approves of the study, the IO  has final say and can disapprove the study. </p>

  <li><em><strong>Evaluation  of the Appeals Process</strong></em>

  <p>After final disposition of a case prompting an  Appeals Process, the IRB Leadership and Enhancement Committee will review the  case and its findings in light of current policies and procedures to determine  whether clarifications, changes in practice, new guidelines or WPPs are  needed.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p class="style4">Responsibility</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the ORSP to ensure that any  requests for appeal are presented to the VCU IRB as part of the agenda. It is  the responsibility of the VCU IRB Leadership and Enhancement Committee Chair to  ensure that a fair hearing of the appeal is permitted.</p>
