  <p class="style4">Objective</p>

<p>To describe the process of review of devices and determination of SR versus NSR. </p>

<p class="style4">Description</p>

<ol type="A">

  <li><em><strong>Device Definitions:</strong></em>

  <ol type="1">

    <li><em>Medical Device:</em> A medical device is defined, in part,  as any health care product that does not achieve its primary intended purposes by chemical action or by being metabolized. Medical devices include, among other things, surgical lasers, wheelchairs, sutures, pacemakers, vascular  grafts, intraocular lenses, and orthopedic pins. Medical devices also include  diagnostic aids such as reagents and test kits for in vitro diagnosis (IVD) of  disease and other medical conditions such as pregnancy. Clinical investigations  of medical devices must comply with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  informed consent and Institutional Review Board (IRB) regulations [21 CFR parts  50 and 56, respectively]. A medical device may be approved for marketing  via the FDA Approval process or 510K process.</li>

    <li><em>Investigational Device:</em> An investigational device is a medical device  that is the subject of a clinical study designed to evaluate the effectiveness and/or safety of the device. Clinical investigations undertaken to develop  safety and effectiveness data for medical devices must be conducted according to the requirements of the IDE regulations [21 CFR part 812]. Certain clinical  investigations of devices (e.g., certain studies of lawfully marketed devices)  may be exempt from the IDE regulations [21 CFR 812.2(c)]. Unless exempt from the IDE regulations, an investigational device must be categorized as  either &quot;significant risk&quot; (SR) or &quot;nonsignificant risk&quot; (NSR). The determination that a device presents a nonsignificant or significant  risk is initially made by the sponsor. The proposed study is then submitted  either to FDA (for SR studies) or to an IRB (for NSR studies).</li>

  </ol>
  
  </li>

        <li><em><strong>Initial Required Action (Making the SR vs. NSR Determination):</strong></em>

    <p class="no_margin">The Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)  regulations [21 CFR part 812] describe two types of device studies,  &quot;significant risk&quot; (SR) and &quot;nonsignificant risk&quot;  (NSR). Where possible, the following text is quoted directly from  the FDA Information Sheet titled &ldquo;Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk  Medical Device Studies.&rdquo;</p>

        <ol>
            
            <li><em>Significant Risk:</em> An SR device study is defined [21 CFR  812.3(m)] as a study of a device that presents a potential for serious risk to  the health, safety, or welfare of a subject and (1) is intended as an implant; or (2) is used in supporting or sustaining human life; or (3) is of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease, or otherwise  prevents impairment of human health; or (4) otherwise presents a potential for  serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. </li>
            
            <li><em>Non-Significant Risk:</em> An NSR device investigation is one that does  not meet the definition for a significant risk study. NSR device studies,  however, should not be confused with the concept of &quot;minimal risk,&quot; a  term utilized in the Institutional Review Board (IRB) regulations [21 CFR Part  56] to identify certain studies that may be approved through an &quot;expedited  review&quot; procedure. For both SR and NSR device studies, IRB approval prior  to conducting clinical trials and continuing review by the IRB are required. In  addition, informed consent must be obtained for either type of study [21 CFR  part 50].</li>
            
            <li><em>Distinguishing Between SR and  NSR Device Studies:</em> NSR device  studies have fewer regulatory controls than SR studies and are governed by the  abbreviated requirements [21 CFR 812.2(b)]. The major differences are in the  approval process and in the record keeping and reporting requirements. The  SR/NSR decision is also important to FDA because the IRB serves, in a sense, as  the Agency's surrogate with respect to review and approval of NSR studies. FDA  is usually not apprised of the existence of approved NSR studies because sponsors and IRBs are not required to report NSR device study approvals to FDA.  If an investigator or a sponsor proposes the initiation of a claimed NSR investigation to the IRB, and if the IRB agrees that the device study is NSR  and approves the study, the investigation may begin at that institution  immediately, without submission of an IDE application to FDA. </li>
            
          </ol>


          <p>If the IRB believes that a device study is SR, the investigation may not begin until both the IRB and FDA approve the investigation.</p>

          <p class="no_margin">To help in the determination of the risk status of the device, the VCU IRB will review information such as:</p>
          
            <ol type="i">

              <li>reports of prior investigations conducted with the device, </li>

              <li>the proposed investigational plan, </li>

              <li>a description of subject selection criteria, and </li>

              <li>monitoring procedures. </li>
              
              </ol>

          <p>The principal investigator/sponsor should provide the IRB with a risk assessment and the rationale used in making its risk  determination [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)].</p>
          
          </li>

  <li><em><strong>SR/NSR Studies and  the IRB / The SR/NSR Decision: </strong></em>

  <ol start="1" type="1">

    <li>Initial Assessment: The assessment of whether or not a device  study presents a NSR is initially made by the sponsor. The sponsor may or  may not be providing financial support for the research study. In some cases, the sponsor may be the manufacturer and/or the investigator. If the sponsor considers that a study is NSR, the sponsor provides the reviewing IRB an explanation of its determination and any other information that may assist  the IRB in evaluating the risk of the study.</li>

    <li>IRB Requests Additional Information, As Needed: If  requested by the IRB, the sponsor should provide the IRB with a description of  the device, reports of prior investigations with the device, the proposed  investigational plan, a description of patient selection criteria and  monitoring procedures, as well as any other information that the IRB deems  necessary to make its decision. If requested by the IRB, the sponsor  should inform the IRB whether other IRBs have reviewed the proposed study and  what determination was made. If requested by the IRB, the sponsor must inform  the IRB of the Agency's assessment of the device's risk if such an assessment  has been made. The IRB may also consult with FDA for its opinion.</li>

    <li><p>IRB Makes It's Own Assessment: The IRB must document Significant  Risk/Nonsignificant Risk device determinations in the minutes and reference the  rationale used by the IRB for the determination.</p>

    <p>The IRB may agree or disagree with the sponsor's initial NSR assessment. If the IRB agrees with the sponsor's initial NSR  assessment and approves the study, the study may begin without submission of an IDE application to FDA. If the IRB disagrees with the sponsor&rsquo;s NSR assessment, the sponsor should notify FDA that an SR determination has been made. The study  can be conducted as an SR investigation following FDA approval of an IDE application. The sponsor, not the IRB is responsible for this  process.</p>

    <p>The risk determination should be based on the  proposed use of a device in an investigation, and not on the device alone. In  deciding if a study poses an SR, an IRB must consider the nature of the harm  that may result from use of the device. Studies where the potential harm to subjects could be life-threatening, could result in permanent impairment of a  body function or permanent damage to body structure, or could necessitate  medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body  function or permanent damage to body structure should be considered SR. Also, if the subject must undergo a procedure as part of the investigational study, e.g., a surgical procedure, the IRB must consider the potential harm that could  be caused by the procedure in addition to the potential harm caused by the device.</p>
    
    </li>

    <li><p>Ultimate Authority: FDA has the ultimate decision in determining  if a device study is SR or NSR. If the Agency does not agree with an IRB's decision that a device study presents an NSR, an IDE application must be  submitted to FDA. The FDA becomes informed of the NSR determination indirectly by the sponsor(s), who must file &quot;abbreviated IDE requirements&quot; {<a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=812.2" target="_blank">21 CFR 812.2(b).</a>}</p>



    <p><strong>NOTES:</strong><br />

      The IRB is not bound by regulations to determine the need for an IDE or &lsquo;abbreviated IDE&rdquo;, but rather is limited to  determinations of SR/NSR (on their own behalf) and reporting such determinations.&nbsp;</p>

      </ol>
      
      </li>

      <li><strong><em>IRB and Sponsor Responsibilities Following SR/NSR Determination:</em></strong>

<ol type="1">

            <li><em>Unique Additional Primary Reviewer Considerations:</em>

            <ol type="a">

              <li>It is the responsibility of the primary reviewer to review all requirements within  this policy prior to the IRB meeting and lead the initial discussion regarding  SR vs. NSR determination.</li>

              <li>It is the responsibility of the primary reviewer to ensure that a valid IDE# has been issued by the FDA (including direct verification with the FDA of the IDE#  and status information provided by the PI) prior to approval of the research.</li>

              <li>It  is the responsibility of the primary reviewer to evaluate the adequacy of the investigator's plans for control of the investigational device. The reviewer may require the use of the  investigational drug pharmacy or central supply for control and monitoring of investigational devices (as appropriate) and may require specific post-approval  monitoring or other stipulations.</li>

              </ol>
              
              </li>

                <li><em>Significant Risk Determination:</em> If the IRB decides the study is Significant  Risk, the following responsibilities must be carried out by the VCU IRB and the Sponsor:

                 <ol type="a">
                   
                   <li>The VCU IRB must document the determination of SR and the rationale.</li>
                   
                   <li>The VCU IRB must notify the sponsor and investigator of the SR decision (in writing  as per the Chairperson).</li>
                   
                   <li>The VCU IRB can proceed to review the study apply the requisite criteria within 21  CFR 56.111 (after the IDE is obtained by the sponsor and proof is provided to the VCU IRB in writing). As an IDE is required for all SR devices and  it is the responsibility of the primary reviewer to check with the FDA (if evidence is not provided within the IRB application) to determine if the IDE#  is valid prior to recommending approval of the research.</li>
                   
                   <li>The sponsor must submit the IDE to FDA or, if electing not to proceed with study,  notify FDA (CDRH Program Operations Staff 301-594-1190) of the SR  determination; </li>
                   
                   <li>The sponsor must ensure that the study does not begin until the FDA approves the  IDE and the VCU IRB approves the study.</li>
                   
                   <li>The sponsor and investigator(s) must comply with the IDE regulations [21 CFR part  812], as well as informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56].</li>
                   
                 </ol>
                 
                 </li>

            <li><em>Non-Significant Risk Determination:</em> If the IRB decides the study is Non-Significant  Risk, the following responsibilities must be carried out by the VCU IRB and the Sponsor:

            <ol type="a">

              <li>VCU IRB minutes must document determination of NSR and the rationale.</li>

              <li>IRB proceeds to review study applying requisite criteria [21 CFR 56.111] </li>

              <li>As an abbreviated IDE is required for all NSR devices and it is the responsibility  of the primary reviewer to check with the FDA (if evidence is not provided  within the IRB application) to determine if the IDE# is valid prior to  recommending approval of the research.</li>

              <li>If the study is approved by the IRB, the sponsor and investigator must comply with  abbreviated IDE requirements (special requirements for the holder/initiator of  the IDE) [21 CFR 812.2(b)], and informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR  parts 50 and 56]. </li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

</li>

          <li><strong><em>The VCU IRB  Decision to Approve/Disapprove:</em></strong>

          <p>Once the SR/NSR decision has been reached, the IRB  will consider whether the study should be approved or not. The criteria for  deciding if SR and NSR studies should be approved are the same as for any other  FDA regulated study [21 CFR 56.111]. The IRB will assure that risks to subjects  are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits and knowledge  to be gained, subject selection is equitable, informed consent materials and  procedures are adequate, and provisions for monitoring the study and protecting  the privacy of subjects are acceptable. To assure that the risks to the subject  are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits, the risks and benefits  of the investigation should be compared to the risks and benefits of  alternative devices or procedures. This differs from the judgment about whether  a study poses a SR or NSR which is based solely upon the seriousness of the  harm that may result from the use of the device. Minutes of IRB meetings must  document the rationale for SR/NSR and subsequent approval or disapproval  decisions for the clinical investigation.</p>

          <p>FDA considers studies of all significant risk  devices to present more than minimal risk; thus, full IRB review for all  studies involving significant risk devices is necessary. Generally, full IRB  review is also required when reviewing NSR studies. Some NSR studies, however,  may qualify as minimal risk [21 CFR 56.102(i)] and the IRB may choose to review  those studies under its expedited review procedures [21 CFR 56.110].</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p class="style4">Responsibility</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the principal investigator (PI) to provide documentation of the sponsor’s SR/NSR determination and the responsibility of the IRB to independently make their own SR/NSR determination, document said determination and rationale, and to review the activity in accordance with initial review procedures.  If the determination of the IRB is SR (and the sponsor’s determination is NSR), the IRB will notify the PI that an IDE is required.  It is the responsibility of the PI to apply for the IDE and inform the IRB upon approval.  Verification of the IDE prior to IRB approval is the responsibility of the primary reviewer.</p>
