            <li id="general_1"><h4>What is an export?</h4>
            	
                <p class="no_margin">An export is an actual shipment or transmission of items, services, or technical data subject to either the EAR or the ITAR out of the United States, or release of technology, software, or technical data subject to either EAR or ITAR to a foreign person in the United States. Technology, software, or technical data is "released" for export through:</p>
                	<ul>
                    	<li>Visual inspection by foreign person of U.S. origin equipment and facilities,</li>
                        <li>Oral exchanges of information in the United States or abroad,</li>
                        <li>Transfer or shipment via any means (physical or electronic) to a foreign entity</li>
                        <li>Providing a service, or the application to situations abroad of personal knowledge or technical experience acquired in the United States</li>
                   	</ul>
       	  </li>
                
                <li id="general_2"><h4>Why should I be concerned about an export?</h4>
                
                	<p>The university campus is open to students and faculty from many different countries. Access to restricted or export controlled technology, commodities, defense articles, and defense services by an unauthorized foreign person could result in severe criminal or civil penalties for the university and the university employee making the export. Prosecution of an export violation may result in fines of up to $1M and/or a prison sentence of up to 20 years.</p>
               	
                </li>
              	
                <li id="general_3"><h4>What is a “deemed export”?</h4>
                
                	<p>Release of technology or source code subject to the EAR to a foreign person in the United States is "deemed" to be an export to the home country of the foreign person under the EAR. Technology is specific information necessary for the development, production, or use of a Commerce Department product controlled for export. “Use” is defined as operation, installation (including on-site installation), maintenance (checking), repair, overhaul and refurbishing.</p>
              	
                </li>
                
                <li id="general_4"><h4>What are “defense services”?</h4>
                	
                    <p>Defense services include the furnishing of assistance to foreign persons, whether or not in the United States, with respect to defense articles, and the furnishing of any technical data associated with a defense article.</p>

        <h3>Export Controls</h3>
        	
        <ul class="list_no_bullets">
            	
                <li id="export_1"><h4>What are export controls?</h4>
                	
                    <p>Export controls are laws and regulations (including ITAR, EAR, and OFAC) that govern the export of certain materials, devices, and technical information outside of the United States or to foreign persons with in the United States.</p>
              	</li>
                
                <li id="export_2"><h4>How do I know if Export Controls apply to my grant/contract?</h4>
                	
                    <p>The Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) will assess the potential for export control applicability to grants and contracts at the time of award. If concerns arise, the PI will be contacted prior to acceptance of the award. If your Sponsor raises the issue of export controls during the conduct of your project, please contact OSP immediately.</p>
              	</li>
                
                <li id="export_3"><h4>What do I do if I think export controls apply to my grant/contract?</h4>
                	
                    <p class="no_margin">Do everything you can to make sure that the work research performed at VCU falls within the parameters of the following exclusions:</p>
                    	<ul>
                        	<li>Fundamental Research Exclusion: Both ITAR and EAR include language that excludes the results of "fundamental research" from export requirements for export licenses or other government approvals. The exclusion applies for basic and applied research in science and engineering performed by universities so long as that research is carried out openly and without restrictions on publication, or foreign person access and dissemination restrictions.</li>
                            
                            <li>Educational Information: authorizes the disclosure, without a license, of educational information released by instruction in catalog courses and associated teaching laboratories of academic institutions and are general scientific, mathematical, or engineering principles commonly taught in universities.</li>
                            
                            <li>Publicly Available Information Exclusion: applies if the information is in the public domain, i.e., if it is publicly available technology and software that is generally accessible to the public through unlimited and unrestricted distribution. Special rules apply to encryption software even if "open source" or publicly available software is being developed. See Encryption rules.</li>
                      	</ul>
                        
                        <p>If you are unsure if your activity falls under one of these exclusions, contact the Office of Research Administration and Compliance and we will assist you.</p>
           	  </li>
                    
                    <li id="export_4"><h4>What are some grant/contract clauses associated with export controls that VCU will not accept?</h4>
                    	<ul>
                        	<li>"The parties acknowledge that the subject of this agreement may be subject to ITAR, EAR and/or other export control regulations as mandated by Federal law. University agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Sponsor harmless from any and all suits, damages or other liabilities resulting from the violation of such regulations.”</li>
                            
                            <li>DFAR 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information<br/>
                            "(a) The Contractor shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor’s organization any unclassified information...”
</li>
                            
                            <li>FAR 52.227-17, Rights in Data – Special Works<br/>
                            “…(d) Release and use restrictions. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this contract, the Contractor shall not use for purposes other than the performance of this contract, nor shall the Contractor release, reproduce, distribute, or publish any data first produced in the performance of this contract, nor authorize others to do so, without written permission of the Contracting Officer…”</li>

                  	</li>
                    
                    <li id="export_5"><h4>If there are no publication restrictions and no personnel restrictions, can I assume that export controls do not apply to my award?</h4>
                    	<p>There is one other issue that should be reviewed. Does your project require VCU to produce and/or deliver any hardware, i.e., equipment, devices or other embodiment of the technology? If so, this may be considered a “defense service” and require an export license. This is one of the considerations OSP reviews when reviewing for export controls.</p>
                        
                   	</li>
                    
                    <li id="export_6"><h4>I would like to ship items outside of the United States. What do I need to know?</h4>
                    	<p>Shipping tangible items outside of the United States usually requires an export license determination to correctly complete the shipping documentation. Sometimes, the university must obtain an export license from the Commerce Department of State Department for the shipment. Failure to obtain the appropriate license or other government approval, or failure to file correct export documentation or shipping documents can result in severe fines and other penalties. The Office of Environmental Health Safety and/or the Office of Research Administration and Compliance can help you be certain your export is in compliance with export and sanction laws, and has correctly filed export and shipping documentation.</p>
                   	</li>
                    
                    <li id="export_7"><h4>What is involved in obtaining and export license?</h4>
                    	<p>A request must be submitted to the Department of Commerce for EAR-controlled items or the Department of State for ITAR-controlled items. Export licenses can take up to 3-6 months for review before a final determination is made. A request for export license would be coordinated through the Office of Research Administration and Compliance – Office of Sponsored Programs.</p>
                   	
                    </li>
                    
                    <li id="export_8"><h4>What happens if I violate export controls laws?</h4>
                    	<p>The consequences for noncompliance are very serious for both the University and the researcher. Penalties may include fines up to $1,000,000, and, for an individual researcher, imprisonment for up to 10 years. These penalties apply to single violations; multiple violations from the same transaction can easily result in enormous penalties. Sanctions on individuals and institutions may include termination of export privileges, suspension/debarment from federal government contracting, and loss of federal funding.</p>
