        	<p>The New Investigators’ Grant Writing Institute (the Institute) provides year-long, intensive proposal development training for VCU faculty from across the university who will apply for extramural funding within 12 months.</p>
            
            <p>Funded by the VCU Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation, the Institute is run annually and changes focus each year.</p>
            
        <p>The 2014-2015 Institute will focus on building skills in proposal development and interdisciplinary communication – both of which are critical to competitive grantsmanship. It will convene an interdisciplinary cohort of new investigators committed to building their grant writing skills, communicating to diverse audiences, and participating in on-going peer review.</p>
    
    		<p><strong>Applications to participate in the 2014-2015 New Investigators’ Grant Writing Institute are due by 5:00pm on August 4, 2014.</strong></p>

        	<p>By participating in this intensive group training, it is expected that researchers will also learn about science across the spectrum of disciplines, and come to a better understanding of how to work collaboratively. The As such, it will offer a combination of modules:</p>
        		<ul>
            		<li><strong>Intensive grant writing workshops</strong>: These sessions will focus on providing step-by-step guidance on grant writing, including Finding the Right Funder; Constructing Specific Aims/Goals &amp; Objectives; Crafting Page 1; Communicating with Program Officers; Conceptualizing the Budget; Identifying VCU Resources; and others. These workshops will begin with a two-day event with guest presenter Dr. Robert Porter, national expert on competitive proposal development.</li>
                	<li><strong>Peer review</strong>: In order to encourage continual writing and growth in your communication style, peer review is a critical component to the Grant Writing Institute. Each participant will be responsible for providing meaningful critiques of the other cohort members’ writing and presentations at a number of stages of development throughout the year.</li>
                	<li><strong>Mock reviews</strong>: Going beyond the peer review, the Mock Review allows participants to receive critical feedback on their proposals from both internal and external content matter experts. Further, this is a dynamic learning experience. Unlike a true review panel meeting, the investigator (and others in the cohort) will be present at the mock review session. This format gives investigators the opportunity to respond to reviewers’ comments, ask questions, and make critical edits before the upcoming deadline as appropriate. Mock reviews will take place multiple times.</li>
                	<li><strong>Agency visits</strong>: Participants will arrange meetings with their cognizant Program Officers in Washington, DC, funded by the program.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mentoring</strong>: Participants will be matched with a scientific mentor, who will provide additional guidance and review. Mentors will receive a modest stipend.</li>

        	<p>The Office of Research and Innovation launched its Grant Writing Institutes effort in 2013-2014 with the CAREER Academy. Its purpose was to provide proposal development support to VCU faculty from across the university who were interested applying to the NSF CAREER Program in 2014 or 2015.</p>
            
            <p>The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program awards are among the most prestigious and competitive NSF awards, which typically support a five-year, $400,000 research program. The CAREER award is intended for faculty members who are at or near the beginning of their careers.</p>
            
            <p>The CAREER Academy provided a portfolio of support and resources to the faculty participants that include step-by-step guidance on developing competitive CAREER proposals, oral and written feedback on proposal drafts, one-on-one mentoring with senior faculty and a mock review panel.</p>
            
            <p>A group of <a href="http://www.spectrum.vcu.edu/recognition-and-honors/career-academy-offers-research-development-support/" target="_blank">11 VCU faculty members</a> were selected to participate in the 2013-2014 CAREER Academy.</p>
            
            <p>The CAREER Academy was funded by the VCU Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation, and supported by the College for Humanities and Sciences and School of Education.</p>
