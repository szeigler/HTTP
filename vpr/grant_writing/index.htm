        	<p>The Virginia Commonwealth University <strong>New Investigators Grant Writing Institutes (GWI)</strong> provide year-long, intensive proposal development training for VCU faculty from across the university who will apply for extramural funding within 12 months. Funded by the VCU Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation, the GWI is run from Fall to early Summer and changes focus each year.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The 2015-2016 Grant Writing Institute will be a CAREER Academy</strong>, targeting faculty who will be applying to the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503214" target="_blank">National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER)</a> in 2016 and 2017.</p>
            
            <p>The CAREER Academy will bring together an interdisciplinary cohort of up to 10 faculty to: build skills in competitive proposal development, learn and practice effective communication to diverse audiences, and participate in on-going critical review.</p>
            
        <p><strong><a href="https://redcap.vcu.edu/rc/surveys/?s=EL7YHN79HR" target="_blank">On-line applications</a> to participate in the 2015-2016 CAREER Academy are due by 5:00pm on June 15, 2015.</strong></p>

        <div class="toggle_list">
        	<p>The CAREER Academy offers several training modules that, when combined over a period of time, aim to steadily build understanding and skills in competitive grantsmanship.</p>
        		<ul>
            		<li><strong>Intensive Proposal Development Workshops</strong>: The cohort participates in monthly group meetings that provide step-by-step guidance developing competitive CAREER proposals; research and project design; persuasive communication and writing; grant writing; grant submission; and building and maintaining relationships with the funder.</li>
                	<li><strong>Peer review</strong>: Each CAREER Academy participant is required to serve as a Primary and Secondary reviewer to other cohort members, and give meaningful feedback about their peers’ proposal drafts at several stages of development throughout the year. This process trains investigators in how to give and receive critique, and in how to better understand the psychology of the grant reviewer.</li>
                	<li><strong>Mock review</strong>: Going beyond the peer review, the Mock Review allows participants to receive critical feedback on their proposals from both internal and external content matter experts. Further, this is a dynamic learning experience. Unlike a true review panel meeting, the investigator has the opportunity to respond to reviewers’ comments, ask questions, and make edits before the upcoming deadline as appropriate.</li>
                	<li><strong>Scientific Mentoring</strong>: Each CAREER Academy cohort member is matched with a scientific mentor, who will provide ongoing guidance and review of the research plan’s intellectual merit. Mentors receive a modest stipend.</li>
                    <li><strong>Writing Labs</strong>: As a continuation of one of the 2014-2015 cohort's own initiatives, Writing Labs offer CAREER Academy faculty scheduled time, dedicated quiet space, mutual support, and facilitation as needed to focus on writing projects -- including publications and other grants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeted Resources</strong>: An extensive collection of resources is available to cohort members through a limited-access Google site and shared folders to facilitate collaboration between cohort members. Prior CAREER Academy participants and awardees have generously added their proposals and reviewer comments to the collection. The site also includes unfunded proposals, reflections from CAREER applicants, advice and presentations from program officers, articles, webinars, and much more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Individualized Support &amp; Technical Assistance</strong>: Each cohort member receives one-on-one attention and assistance. As their research and proposals develop, take new paths, and accelerate at different rates, facilitators to provide guidance, support and encouragement.</li>
