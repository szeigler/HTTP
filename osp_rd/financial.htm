    	<h4>Budget Overview</h4>
			<p>The budget is an estimate of costs needed to perform the proposed externally-sponsored project. Each line item should be detailed and justifiable. Most federal and many private sponsors provide budget forms which should be completed in accordance with sponsor guidelines.</p>
            
            <p>The budget reflects full direct and indirect costs of the project.  Generally the goal is for the sponsor to fully fund all project costs.</p>
            
      	<h4>Direct Costs</h4>
        	<p class="no_margin">Expenses directly allocated to a specific sponsored project. Typical direct cost categories include:</p>
            	<ul>
                <li>Personnel: All personnel on the project should be identified by name and/or by role.  The budget captures the percentage of time ("effort") for each person working on the project. Each person has 100% or 12.0 months of potential effort. The requested amount for each person is calculated by multiplying their base salary by the percentage of effort.</li>
                <li>Fringe Benefits: Employee benefits paid by the employer. (e.g., FICA, Worker's Compensation, Withholding Tax, Insurance, etc.) The negotiated fringe benefit rates for sponsored project personnel categories can be found in the current DHHS Rate Agreement.</li>
                <li>Materials and Supplies: Expendable items needed to perform the project. Examples include: reagents, chemicals, pipettes, animal expenses, etc. Office supplies are generally unallowable as direct costs.</li>
                <li>Capital Equipment:  Articles of nonexpendable, tangible personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost which equals or exceeds $5000. Capital equipment must be directly required for the performance of the proposed project and be based on a price quote. The cost estimate or quote should include: name of item, model number, manufacturer, name of vendor, contact person and telephone. Consult sponsor guidelines for allowability of equipment charges.</li>
                <li>Travel: Identify domestic and/or foreign travel required by the project. Generally only personnel working on the project may travel at the project's expense.  Provide a breakdown of costs according to destination, purpose, number of travelers, number of trips, etc.  Comply with Fly America Act provisions. Consult sponsor guidelines for allowability of travel costs.</li>
                <li>Consultants: An individual or organization that provides services of an advisory nature necessary for the sponsored project. Identify the consultant by name, specialty, daily rate and justification for their use. VCU employees cannot serve as consultants on VCU sponsored projects.</li>
                <li>Printing and Publication Costs: Estimate the number of pages, page charges, and name(s) of journal(s).</li>
                <li>Subcontracts/Subawards: List the name and address of all subcontractors/subawardees and total requested direct and indirect costs (based on subrecipient's budget.)</li>
                <li>Alterations and/or Renovations: Itemize the costs of alterations and/or renovations associated with real property.  These costs are rare and most often seen on construction grants.</li>
                <li>Other Direct Costs: Identify direct costs not already itemized in the budget. Examples include: tuition remission, animal per diem, patient travel stipend, post doctoral health insurance. [Avoid listing supplies and equipment under "Other."]</li>
          	</ul>
            
    	<h4>Indirect Costs</h4>
        	<p>Costs that are incurred for common or joint objectives and, therefore, cannot be identified readily and specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other institutional activity. The term Facilities &amp; Administration ("F&amp;A") Costs is synonymous with Indirect Costs ("IDC") and are sometimes called "overhead".</p>
            
            <p>Examples of indirect costs include: library services; payroll, purchasing, human resources and other centrally-provided services; administrative and clerical costs; building use and maintenance, to name a few. F&amp;A costs are calculated as a percentage of direct costs. These F&amp;A rates are set through negotiation between the university and its cognizant agency in the federal government. VCU's cognizant agency is the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).</p>
            
            <p>Determine from your sponsor's guidelines whether F&amp;A costs should be calculated based on "Total Direct Costs" (TDC) or "Modified Total Direct Costs" (MTDC). TDC includes all direct costs. MDTC excludes some direct costs from the calculation base.  Our negotiated rate agreement defines which direct cost items should be excluded on an MTDC budget. MTDC shall exclude: equipment; subcontracts in excess of $25,000, tuition, patient care costs, rental of off-site facilities, capital expenditures, fellowships and scholarships. If not specifically excluded, all direct costs including the first $25,000 of each subcontract are subject to F&amp;A.</p>
            
            <p>Indirect costs apply to all types of sponsored projects (grants, contracts, cooperative agreements) funded by federal, state or private sponsors. F&amp;A cost rates will vary according to whether the project is research, instruction or other and whether 50% or more of the project is performed on or off campus. Consult the DHHS rate agreement for current rates, and contact OSP for updates and questions. Please note that the industry-sponsored clinical trial rate is a fixed percentage of TDC.</p>
                
   		<h4>Prepare Modular Budget</h4>
        	<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) distinguishes between "modular" and "detailed" budget formats. Modular budgets request up to $250,000 in direct costs per year in $25,000 increments. A modular budget justification provides information on all Personnel by position, role and level of effort, and provides the cost estimate for any consortium/contractual obligations. Details on the costing of supplies, travel and other "non-personnel", and "non-consortium" expenses should not be provided to NIH. That said, the university requires that a detailed internal budget be prepared to ensure accurate costing of expenses and to ensure F&amp;A costs are correctly calculated.</p>
            
            <p>A typical modular grant application will request the same number of modules in each year. Variances to requesting the same number of modules must be explained in the budget justification. Additionally, any expenses that are excluded from F&amp;A calculations such as equipment, tuition, rent, etc. should be described.</p>
            
     	<h4>Prepare Detailed Budget</h4>
        	<p>Most sponsors require a detailed budget, or cost estimate, that provides a concise listing of ALL direct and indirect costs needed for completion of the project. Examples of direct cost categories include Personnel (faculty, staff, hourly wages and associate fringe benefits), Equipment, Supplies, Patient Care, Alterations/Renovations, Travel, Subrecipient/Consortium and Other (such as tuition, rent, contractual services, etc.) Indirect costs are shown on the budget separately from direct costs.</p>
            
     	<h4>Prepare Loaded Budget</h4>
        	<p>A loaded budget is one in which each line item expense includes both direct and associated indirect costs added together (aka "loaded".) Example: a $1000 supply item with an associated 50% IDC rate would list as $1500. Loaded budgets are most often provided to for profit sponsors.</p>
               
  		<h4>Project includes Ancillary Services</h4>
        	<p>Some projects require the services of units within the university or hospital such as pharmacy, radiology, pathology, survey research lab, to name but a few. When planning to use these "ancillary services" it is important that your budget is based on accurate costs for such services. For clinical trials and clinical research, these costing estimates for ancillary service agreements should be included with other proposal documents.</p>
            
            <p>Through a partnership with the VCU Health System and VCU, a standardized fee schedule has been developed and implemented and is hosted on the Center for Clinical and Translational Research (CCTR) website. This fee schedule has set standardized rates for both industry and non-industry clinical trials and clinical research. These are fixed prices that the ancillaries will be required to quote and charge to study teams.</p>
            
    	<h4>Cost-Share</h4>
        	<p>Cost share is a formal commitment to provide institutional funds in lieu of requesting full financial support from the sponsor. It represents a commitment by the University to provide necessary resources to a sponsored project in order to fulfill the project aims and/or milestones.</p>
            
            <p>Cost sharing must be (1) verifiable and approved by the responsible Dean or Department Chair and the Office of Research and Innovation through signature on the IAF (at proposal time) and a completed Cost Sharing Authorization Form and (2) tracked and incurred during the effective dates of the project by Grants &amp; Contracts Accounting.</p>
            
            <p class="no_margin">Cost share can take the form of actual dollars such as tuition waiver or personnel salaries, or in-kind contributions such as space or equipment usage. Cost share types are described below:</p>
            	<ul>
                	<li>Mandatory: cost share required by a sponsor as a condition of making an award. If Mandatory Cost Sharing is required, the requirement is always specified in the published description of the program announcement. The requirement is usually expressed in terms of a percentage of the total project cost or a percentage of the sponsor share of the total project cost although occasionally it is expressed as a fixed dollar amount.</li>
                    
                    <li>Voluntary Committed: offered by University in a proposal to reflect accurately the total resources necessary to complete a project. This offer is incorporated in the award directly or by reference. Voluntary Committed cost sharing expenses must be properly identified for cost accounting purposes, but are not generally included on financial reports to sponsors.</li>
                    
                    <li>Voluntary Uncommitted: cost share that is not committed or budgeted for in a sponsored agreement. It need not be tracked for cost accounting purposes or reported to the sponsor, and if it arises from faculty or other personnel effort, it is excluded from separate identification in effort reporting. Voluntary Uncommitted Cost Sharing most commonly results from a cost overrun on a project, or from researchers’ effort which is over and above that committed and budgeted for in a sponsored agreement.</li>
              	</ul>
                    
          	<p>It is important to remember that any cost sharing that is included with a proposal application, once awarded by the sponsor, becomes a condition of the award (regardless of whether it was mandatory or voluntary committed at the time of proposal.) The PI/departmental staff must maintain sufficient documentation to substantiate that the actual cost sharing commitment is in compliance with OMB guidance. Plan to meet cost share obligations required by the sponsor, but do not overstate University cost share in the application.</p>
            
            <p>Cost sharing should not be offered for industry-sponsored projects; institutional taxpayer-provided funds should not subsidize for profit companies.</p>
            
       	<h4>Program Income</h4>
        	<p>Generally, the only funds for a sponsored project come from the sponsor. Occasionally, revenue funds are generated by the project in some way. When this occurs, there is “program income” and a program income account (linked to the primary account) must be created. Need for a program income account can generally be predicted at the time of proposal and is carried out at award time.  If unexpected program income results from a project that is underway, contact OSP for assistance.</p>
            
            <p>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines program income to be gross income earned by the recipient that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the award. The OMB provides the standard for how a federal agency and a grant recipient will handle program income. The sponsor has the authority to prescribe (in the notice of award) the use of program income according to the alternatives provided in the federal guidance, i.e. deductive, additive, or matching. "Deductive" program income reduces the amount of the sponsor's award. "Additive" program income supplements the amount of the sponsor's award.  "Matching" program income is used to partially or fully meet a cost share requirement. Generally the award notice will provide guidance on how program income should be spent, most typically in support of project goals.</p>
            
            <p>Program income includes, but is not limited to, income from fees for services performed, the use or rental of real or personal property acquired under federally-funded projects, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under an award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, and interest on loans made with award funds. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, program income does not include the receipt of principal on loans, rebates, credits, discounts, etc., or interest earned on any of them.</p>
            
      	<h4>Personnel Effort</h4>
        	<p>The Principal Investigator (PI) as well as faculty and staff associated with a project are required to include some level of committed effort on most sponsored research activities. Effort commitments must be quantified as a percentage of time, dollar amount of salary, and/or number of calendar (12.0), academic (9.0) or summer (3.0) months in the proposal. These commitments are paid by the sponsor, and in some cases, by the university. Effort commitments are calculated on an annual basis. The specific amount of effort committed to a particular sponsored activity is left to the judgement of the PI, based on his/her estimate of the effort necessary to meet the technical goals and outcomes of the project.</p>
            
            <p>No investigator can commit more than 100% of their time to all active sponsored projects. 100% effort is also defined to be 12.0 calendar months or 9.0 academic + 3.0 summer months. 100% effort is not based on a 40 hour work week, rather it is based on the individual's total professional obligations.</p>
    	
        <h4>Minimum Effort for Key Personnel</h4>
        	<p>Principal Investigators (PIs) and Key Personnel are required to include some level of committed effort on most sponsored research activities. The minimum amount of effort committed to a specific sponsored research activity may be no less than 1% of the Key Personnel's University Effort. Beyond this minimum, the specific amount of effort committed to a particular sponsored activity is left to the judgement of the PI, based on his/her estimate of the effort necessary to meet the technical goals and outcomes of the project. Typical exclusions are noted in the Minimum Effort for Key Personnel on Sponsored Project policy.</p>
