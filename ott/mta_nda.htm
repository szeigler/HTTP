	<h2>Material Transfer and Nondisclosure Agreements</h2>
    
    	<p>As a service to VCU faculty and staff, VCU Innovation Gateway reviews, negotiates and executes Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) and  Nondisclosure Agreements (NDAs). We  strive to execute these agreements as quickly as possible so that you can  continue with your research. Although  standardized contract language exists for MTAs and NDAs, a significant  percentage of universities and an even higher percentage of companies do not  adhere to such language. Below, we describe  the purpose of MTAs and NDAs and some of the issues that may be involved in  getting these agreements completed.</p>
        
        <p>If you need an MTA or NDA completed as part of your  research, please contact VCU Innovation Gateway. It will be helpful to forward us  the correspondence that you had with the other party and any draft agreements  that they may have sent to <a href="mailto:ott@vcu.edu">ott@vcu.edu</a> or mail to VCU Innovation Gateway P.O. Box 980568.</p>

	<h3 id="mta">Material Transfer Agreements</h3>

		<p>An MTA is a contract that states the terms and conditions for the transfer of tangible research materials between VCU and an outside  organization. The outside organization could be another university or a for-profit company. An MTA with a for-profit company (e.g., pharmaceutical)  is usually very different from one with another university. If you are seeking to get tangible materials  from an outside organization, then we will be negotiating an &ldquo;Incoming&rdquo;  MTA. For Incoming MTAs, we will usually  be reviewing and approving the outside organization&rsquo;s MTA draft. If an outside organization has requested  access to some of your research materials, we will draft and negotiate an  &ldquo;Outgoing&rdquo; MTA. Generally, the materials are transferred without the expectation of getting them back.</p>

		<p>A wide variety of tangible research materials can be transferred. Biological research materials may include unique plasmids and vectors, cell lines or other cultures, viruses and genetically modified animals. Other research materials may include unique reagents, chemicals and engineered materials. The MTA draft will describe the materials to be transferred, describe the recipient&rsquo;s research that will be conducted using the materials and will  specify a defined period of time that materials may be used for the research. Materials that are not unique to VCU and are  readily available from other sources or for purchase generally do not need to  be transferred under an MTA.</p>
        
        <p>If you are using materials obtained under an MTA, please  review the terms and conditions of that agreement to ensure that VCU does not break its contractual obligations with the other organization. MTAs that involve <a href="../human_research/index.htm" target="_blank">human</a> or <a href="https://www.vcu.edu/research/acup/index.htm">animal</a> research or <a href="http://www.vcu.edu/oehs" target="_blank">hazardous materials</a> may require  additional approvals before the MTAs are executed and the materials  transferred.</p>

	<h3 id="nda">Nondisclosure Agreements</h3>
    
    	<p>An NDA is a contract that states the terms and conditions for the sharing of confidential information between VCU and an outside organization. Confidential information is shared under a valid NDA between VCU and another organization so that the  parties can consider entering into a license or research agreement, or discuss a possible collaboration or funding opportunity. Confidential information may include unpublished details of inventions, business methods and plans, research  protocols and proposals, research results and software code. VCU information which has been publicly  disclosed (either orally or in writing) will not be considered confidential under an NDA.</p>
    
    	<p>If both VCU and the outside party will be sharing confidential information, then a Bilateral NDA will be executed. If only one party will be sharing their confidential information, then a unilateral NDA will be executed. NDAs typically will define the nature of the confidential information to be shared and will have short period of time (usually 1 year) in which the confidential information can be shared and a long  period of time (3 to 10 years) in which the receiving party must not disclose the other party&rsquo;s confidential information. Usually, when confidential information is transferred to the other  party, it must to marked &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; in order for it to actually be  considered confidential under the agreement. VCU faculty and staff have an obligation to protect an outside party&rsquo;s  confidential information and should only disclose such information to other VCU  faculty and staff on a &ldquo;need-to-know&rdquo; basis.</p>

	<h3>Potential Issues with MTAs and NDAs </h3>

		<p>VCU Innovation Gateway works to quickly review, negotiate and  execute all MTAs and NDAs that are requested by VCU members. We often receive agreement drafts that  contain legal language or conditions that are problematic. Problems may arise if the agreement contains  clauses that we are not allowed by the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Attorney General&rsquo;s Office  to have in contractual agreements. In addition to particular legal clauses that we are not allowed to have in  agreements, the agreement may contain other contractual conditions requested by  the other party that are detrimental to you, your sponsor and/or VCU. Some of the most common problematic clauses  and their typical resolutions are listed below. In most cases, we are able to successfully negotiate these problematic  clauses by drafting mutually acceptable terms and conditions in order to  quickly get the agreements completed. However,  in rare cases, the other organization will not allow any changes in their  draft, and we will not be able to execute the agreement. We will keep you informed on any issues as  they may arise.</p>

		<p><em>Common Problems in  MTAs and NDAs and Their Resolutions</em></p>

		<p><em><strong>Choice of Law and Courts</strong></em>: Contractual agreements  often specify which state law the parties want the agreement to be governed by  and which courts will be used if a dispute arises. As a Commonwealth  of Virginia institution we prefer to  have Virginia  law in the agreement. We are not allowed  to sign any agreement that specifies the laws of any other state or  country. Many organizations want their  agreements to be governed by their own state or country law. Resolution &ndash; We agree that neither party gets  favored choice of law and we simply delete the choice of law clause.</p>

		<p><em><strong>Indemnification and Hold Harmless Clauses</strong></em>: We often get agreement drafts from  universities and companies that require that VCU will defend and protect that party from any legal actions that may result from our use of the material or  information. This is a requirement for indemnification. We are not allowed to  indemnify another organization. Resolution &ndash; We use standard language that states that VCU will be  responsible for its own actions.</p>
        
        <p><em><strong>Assignment of Future Inventions and Creations under the  Agreement</strong></em>: In consideration for  sending their materials, companies often want to take ownership of any  inventions or creations that you may develop using the materials or information. In some cases, the company  may be concerned that you might develop an invention that may interfere with their ability to market their own products or services.&nbsp; Assignment clauses are only acceptable to VCU  in rare circumstances and require special approval. Resolution &ndash; We can offer to license  inventions that rely on the use of their materials. See the discussion on licenses below.</p>

		<p><em><strong>Free Licenses and Options to License New VCU Inventions</strong></em>: A company may ask for a free license to any  invention you develop that is related to the use of their material. Although we would still be able to  nonexclusively license an invention to another company, it would be very  difficult to nonexclusively commercialize an invention that may require FDA approval. Alternatively, the company may  ask for an option to negotiate a fee-bearing exclusive license for inventions. This is generally acceptable  to VCU unless there is a possibility that research tool might be developed  under the agreement. NIH has a policy that  research tools developed under NIH funding be commercialized nonexclusively so  that the tool can be widely used by other laboratories. In other cases, this kind of language in a  MTA might conflict with the terms and conditions of another MTA and research agreement with another company. Resolution &ndash; We will work closely with you to ensure that any licensing terms are suitable to you, VCU and your sponsor.</p>

		<p><em><strong>Restrictions on Publications</strong></em>: Almost all MTAs with companies will have some  language that allows the company to review a manuscript before it is submitted  for publication. Mainly, the company  wants to be able to remove any of their own proprietary information from the  manuscript and may want to seek patent protection for any inventions disclosed  in the paper. The company may demand a  very long period of time to review you manuscript, which may have a significant  impact on your ability to publish. The  company may also want to be able remove VCU proprietary information from the  paper. Resolution &ndash; VCU Innovation Gateway believes that your ability to publish should be protected. We prefer that the company has a maximum of 30  days to review your manuscripts and cannot remove any text and results other  than their own confidential information.</p>
